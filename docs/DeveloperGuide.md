### Architecture
![ArchitectureDiagram.png](img/ClassDiagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the YMFC App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Main components of the architecture
`YMFC` (consisting of `YMFC` class) is in charge of app launch and shut down. 
- At app launch, it initialises the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following components:
- `UI`: The user interface of the App. It handles user interaction, namely reading user input and displaying messages.
- `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. 
Responsible for loading and saving both recipes and ingredients.
- `Parser`: The command parser. It interprets user inputs,
turning them into `Command` objects that are executed by the app. 
- `Command`: Represents actions that the user can perform, such as adding, deleting or listing recipes and ingredients.
- `RecipeList` and `IngredientList`: These manage collections of recipes and ingredients, respectively. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### How the architecture components interact with each other
The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the application is first launched.

![ApplicationStartUp.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/ApplicationStartUp.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- @@author 3CCLY -->

### `Ui` Class
The `Ui` class deals with taking in inputs from an input stream (in this case, the user input through `System.in`), 
and then printing messages read-able by the user (through `System.out`).

### `Recipe` Class
The `Recipe` class represents a singular recipe added by the user or loaded from the storage database. 
A valid recipe object contains the following fields:
+ Name
+ List of Ingredients
+ List of Steps
+ Cuisine (optional)
+ Time taken (optional)

The formatting of how a recipe is displayed and saved is handled by this class.

### `RecommendedRecipe` Class
The `RecommendedRecipe` class represents a recipe to recommend to the user with relevant statistics.
A `RecommendedRecipe` object contains the following:
+ Recipe (The `Recipe` being recommended)
+ Percentage Match (The percentage of the recipe's ingredients that the user has in their list of ingredients)
+ Missing Ingredients (A list of the recipe's ingredients that the user lack)

#### `SortByPercentMatch` Class
The `SortByPercentMatch` class inherits from the Java `Comparator` class to overload its compare method. 
This is used to allow Java methods like sort which uses this method to know how to compare two `RecommendedRecipe` 
objects based on their percentage match attribute. The compare method is implemented such that when used to sort 
a list of `RecommendedRecipe` objects, they are sorted in descending order based on their percentage match attribute.

### `RecipeList` Class
The `RecipeList` class represents a list of recipes. 
This class handles the addition, deletion and editing of recipes.

![RecipeClassDiagram.png](img/ClassDiagrams/recipesClassDiagram.png)

### `Ingredient` Class
The `Ingredient` class represents an individual ingredient added by the user or loaded from the storage database.

#### Implementation Details

1. Attributes:
   - `String Name`
     - Stores the name of the ingredient, which serves as its unique identifier
2. Constructor:
   - `Ingredient(String name)`: 
     - Initializes an `Ingredient` instance with the specified name
3. Methods:
   - `boolean equals(Ingredient ingredientToCheck)`:
     - Compares the current `Ingredient` with another `Ingredient` based on their names
   - `@Override boolean equals(Object object)`:
     - An overridden method that supports Java collection operations like `retainAll()` and `removeAll()`, allowing ingredients 
to be compared based on name alone in collections
   - `String toString()`:
     - Returns the ingredient's name
   - `String toSaveString()`:
     - Returns a formatted string for saving ingredient data to a text file
     - Follows the format: `new n/<ingredient_name>`

The formatting of how an ingredient is displayed and saved is handled by this class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `IngredientList` Class
The `IngredientList` class represents a list of ingredients.
This class handles the addition, deletion and editing of ingredients.

#### Implementation Details
1. Attributes: 
   - `ArrayList<Ingredient> ingredients`: Holds a list of `Ingredient` objects, representing the ingredients in the list
2. Constructor:
   - `IngredientList()`:
   Initializes an empty list of ingredients.
3. Methods:
   - `void addIngredient(Ingredient ingredient)`:
     - Adds an `Ingredient` to the list 
   - `ArrayList<Ingredient> getIngredients()`:
     - Returns the current list of ingredients
   - `Ingredient getIngredient(int id)`:
     - Retrieves an ingredient by its index in the list
   - `boolean removeIngredientByName(String name)`:
     - Removes an `Ingredient` by name
     - Returns true if the ingredient was found and removed, otherwise false
   - `int getCounter()`:
     - Returns the number of ingredients in the list
   - `void sortAlphabetically()`:
     - Sorts the ingredients list alphabetically by ingredient name

### `Command` Classes
The `Command` class deals with all the possible commands accepted by YMFC, with each command representing a specific 
recognised user input (E.g. `ListCommand` representing the command to list all the recipes in the `recipeList`).

#### 1. The `Command` base class
- Serves as the abstract parent class for all specific commands
- Defines the basic structure and contract that each command class must follow
- Each command performs a unique operation and can be expanded to include more functionality as required by YMFC
- Standardises command behavior and establishes an inheritance hierarchy, allowing for the seamless addition and usage 
of command functionalities
- Core Elements:
  - `isBye`: A flag that tracks if an exit command has been issued, following which programme should be terminated
    - Set by calling `setBye() `
    - Checked with `isBye()`
  - `execute()`: An abstract method that must be implemented by all subclasses
    - Defines the primary action performed by the command (E.g. add new recipe to `recipeList` for `AddRecipeCommand`)

Shown below is a class diagram detailing the interaction between the parent `Command` class and it's child classes:
![commandClassesShort.png](img/ClassDiagrams/commandsShortClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!-- @@author gskang-22 -->

#### 2. Command Flow (Using `Command` Classes)
1. Initialisation: Instantiate a `Command` subclass by passing user input through the `parseCommand()` of `Parser`
2. Exit signal: If a command is meant to terminate the app (E.g. `ByeCommand`), set `isBye` to true
3. Execution: Call `execute()`, performing the desired action and interacting with YMFC's data and UI components

#### 3. Adding new `Command` Classes
- Create a `Command` class:
  1. Inherit from `Command`: Each new command class extends `Command`, inheriting its structure and providing a specific 
implementation of the `execute()` method
  2. Override `execute()`: Implement `execute()` to define how the command should interact with `RecipeList`,
`IngredientList`, `Ui`, and `Storage`
  3. Additional methods (Optional): You may add helper methods within the class if necessary
- Register the command
  1. Update the `parseCommand()` method in `Parser` to recognise and instantiate the new command

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `Command` Child Classes

#### 1. `AddCommand` Class
- The `AddCommand` class adds a newly created Recipe object to the current RecipeList object's ArrayList of Recipes

<!-- @@author -->

Shown below is a sequence diagram detailing how a new recipe is added using the AddCommand object,
starting from parsing the user input to the addition of the recipe to the recipeList object,
to finally printing the "recipe added" message to the User on the CLI:
![AddCommand.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/AddRecipesSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- @@author 3CCLY -->

#### 2. `EditCommand` Class

- The `EditCommand` class finds an existing recipe in RecipeList by name, and then replaces its parameter
with the new parameters that the user inputted.

Shown below is a sequence diagram detailing how an existing recipe is modified using the EditCommand object,
starting from parsing the user input to finding the exiting recipe in the RecipeList object,
to finally modifying and saving the recipe in the RecipeList:
![EditCommand.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/EditRecipesSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!-- @@author gskang-22 -->

#### 3. `AddIngredientCommand` Class
- The `AddIngredientCommand` class is responsible for adding a new ingredient to `IngredientList`
- When executed, it takes an `Ingredient` object, adds it to the `IngredientList`, saves the updated list to the storage, and 
notifies the user of the addition through the `Ui` component.

#### 4. `ByeCommand` Class
- The `ByeCommand` class represents the command to terminate the application
- When executed, it signals the application to exit by setting a flag (`isBye`) 
and displays a farewell message to the user

#### 5. `DeleteCommand`
- The `DeleteCommand` class represents the command to delete a recipe by its name from `RecipeList` 
- When executed, this command searches `RecipeList` for the recipe, removes it if found, saves the updated list to the
storage, and informs the user of the successful deletion or an error if the recipe is not found

#### 6. `DeleteIngredientCommand` Class
- The `DeleteIngredientCommand` class is responsible for deleting an `Ingredient` from the `IngredientList` based on 
its name
- Upon execution, it removes the specified `Ingredient`, updates the `Ingredientlist` in the storage, and notifies 
the user about the deletion
<!-- @@author -->

<!-- @@author sukkaito -->

#### 7. `FindCommand` Class
- The `FindCommand` class is used to find recipes based on user's query and options
- When executed, a list of matching recipes extracted from `RecipeList` will be printed out using the 
`printFind()` method from the `Ui` class
- If no matching recipe is found, method `printEmptyFind()` will be used instead

<!-- @@author -->

<!-- @@author seanngja -->

#### 8. `FindIngredientCommand` Class
- The `FindIngredientCommand` attempts to find an existing `Ingredient` in `IngredientList` by name
- When executed, it calls the `printFindIngred()` method of the `Ui` to display the matching ingredients found
- If no matching ingredient is found, the `printEmptyFindIngred()` of `Ui` method is called instead

<!-- @@author -->
<!-- @@author gskang-22 -->
#### 9. `HelpCommand` Class
- The `HelpCommand` class is designed to provide the user with a list of available commands and detailed instructions 
on how to use them
- When executed, it calls the `printHelp()` method of the `Ui` to display help information

#### 10. `ListCommand` Class
- The `ListCommand` class is designed to list all the recipes present in the `RecipeList`
- When executed, it retrieves the list of recipes and displays them to the user through the `UI`

#### 11. `ListIngredientCommand` Class
- The `ListIngredientCommand` class is responsible for listing all the ingredients currently stored in the 
`IngredientList`
- When executed, it retrieves the list of ingredients and displays them to the user through the `UI`
<!-- @@author -->

<!-- @@author 3CCLY -->

#### 12. `RandomCommand` Class
- The `RandomCommand` class is designed to show the user a randomly selected recipe from their recipeList
- When executed, it retrieves the list of recipes, pick a random valid index for the list, and display that recipe 
through the `Ui`

#### 13. `RecommendCommand` Class
- The `RecommendCommand` class selects all recipes from the RecipeList and displays those that share common 
ingredients with what is found in IngredientList. The percentage of the recipe's ingredients that are shared, as well 
as the missing ingredients are also determined
- When executed, it retrieves the list of ingredients, and search through the list of recipes for those that meet the 
criteria. These recipes are then displayed through `Ui` with their accompanying statistics, listed by descending order 
of their percentage match

<!-- @@author -->

<!-- @@author KSanjith -->

#### 14. `SortCommand` Class
- The `SortCommand`class is designed to sort all the existing recipes in the `RecipeList`
- When executed, depending on the user's input parameter, it will either sort the recipes alphabetically by name,
or in ascending numerical order of time taken
- It will then list out the newly ordered recipes to the user, and update the save file with the new order of recipes

#### 15. `SortIngredientCommand` Class
- The `SortIngredientCommand`class is designed to sort all the existing ingredients in the `IngredientList`
- When executed, it will sort the ingredients alphabetically by name
- It will then list out the newly ordered ingredients to the user, and update the save file with the new order of ingredients

### Parser Class
Self-explanatory, made for parsing user's input command. This class only consist of one public static method 
`parseCommand()` in order to process input commands.
The remaining private methods represent separated cases for different commands.

Shown below is a sequence diagram detailing how the Parser class interprets the user's CLI input
and returns the appropriate command object containing the user's input parameters.
![parseCommandShort.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/ParseCommandShortSequenceDiagram.png)
Note: The `getXYZCommand(args)` method is used for commands that further need to extract parameters from the user's input
beyond just the command name, such as for the `sort` command which needs to extract from the input, the type of sort that
is requested. In the example of the sort command, the `getXYZCommand(args)` method is called `getSortCommand()`.

### `Storage` Class
The `Storage` class 
1. Saves the User's added recipes to a `.txt` file
  - Empty save files are created immediately once YMFC is launched for the first time
    - New empty save files are also created upon launch if the previous ones were deleted by the user
  - Saving recipes is done every time the recipes are modified in any way (such as added, deleted, sorted or edited)
  - The following Sequence diagram shows how the `saveRecipes()` method in the Storage class
    saves all the created recipes into the `.txt` file

![saveRecipes.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/SaveRecipesSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

2. Reads the `.txt` save files to load in past saved recipes immediately when app is launched
  - If the user had modified the save files to contain irregular lines of text, then they are simply ignored.
    - A message is printed to the CLI to alert user of the irregular lines within the save file
    - The irregular lines are immediately deleted from the save files
  - The following Sequence diagram shows how the `loadRecipes()` method in the `Storage` class
    loads in past saved recipes from the `.txt` file when the app is first launched
    - The sequence diagram does not show how irregular lines within save files are handled, and only describes how regular, properly formatted save files are loaded in

![loadRecipes.png](img/SequenceDiagrams/LoadRecipesSequenceDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class also saves and loads the list of user's available ingredients to another `.txt` save file.
The mechanisms with which it does so is highly similar to the 2 sequence diagrams above.

### Exception Class
There is a main `YMFCException` class that extends the `Exception` class.
There are then 4 child exception classes that inherit from the `YMFCException` class.
* `EmptyListException`:
  * This exception is thrown mainly in the Parser class whenever the user inputs a command that would not work 
  with an empty list of recipes or ingredients
    * e.g. If the recipe cookbook is empty, and the user inputs the edit command, then this exception will be thrown. 
      * Because there are no recipes in the empty cookbook that can be edited
* `InvalidArgumentException`:
  * This exception is mainly thrown in the Parser class whenever the user's input command has invalid arguments
* `InvalidCommandException`:
  * This exception is mainly thrown in the Parser class whenever the user's input does not match the available commands
* `InvalidSaveLineException`:
  * This exception is thrown whenever the save-load system encounters lines within the save file that 
  are not of the proper syntax

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product scope

#### Target user profile:
Cooks who want to quickly search up recipes or get recipe suggestions based on their available ingredients

#### Value proposition:
Cooks these days have more recipes than they know how to handle, and our product will help them store, retrieve and
search through their recipes with ease. Users can also store their available inventory of ingredients. 
Prompts, tags and ingredients can be used to search a curated database, and even recommend recipes that contain 
whatever ingredients the user has on hand.
