# Developer Guide for SpendSwift

## Design & Implementation
### Architecture
A high-level overview of the system is shown in the Architecture Diagram below.

![Architecture Diagram](classdiagrams/Architecture%20Diagram.drawio.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Main Components  
SpendSwift class is in charge of launching the program, 
and initialising the components that does the main execution of the program.
- UI: Prints messages
- Parser: Determines the command to execute and checks the logic 
- Command: Determines the feature the user wants to use
- Storage: Writes data to, and reads data from hard disk

### Overall Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram below describes how the components interacts with one another when the user issues a command.

In this sequence diagram, all the components would be grouped together and simplified for easier understanding. 
- All the commands, which are all the classes in the commands package, would be classified under `:Command` here.
- All storage classes would be classified under `:Storage`

![Overal Sequence Diagram](classdiagrams/Overall%20Sequence%20Diagram.drawio.png)

**The sections below give more details of the components and any additional components.**

## Class Diagrams
### Storage

![Storage Class Diagram](classdiagrams/Storage.drawio.png)

`Storage` is designed to handle the saving and loading of data for categories and expenses within the program.
- `Storage`: Coordinates the loading and saving of data for both categories and expenses. 
It creates and manages instances of `ExpenseStorage` and `CategoryStorage`.
- `ExpenseStorage`: Responsible for loading and saving expense data to a file. 
Each expense record contains the expense name, amount, and category.
- `CategoryStorage`: Manages category data, including category names and optional budget limits. 
It loads and saves categories to a file, ensuring the integrity of category data and budget associations.


The `Storage` class employs composition to manage instances of `ExpenseStorage` and `CategoryStorage`. 
This design centralizes all data storage-related operations within Storage, providing a single interface for other 
parts of the system to interact with. By encapsulating these operations, any changes to data-saving or loading 
processes can be isolated within the individual storage classes, minimizing the impact on the rest of the application.

This structure separates expenses and categories into distinct storage classes — `ExpenseStorage` and `CategoryStorage` 
— which clarifies their respective responsibilities. This separation promotes modularity and enhances maintainability 
by ensuring each storage class focuses exclusively on managing one type of data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Parser

![Parser Class Diagram](classdiagrams/Parser.drawio.png)

`Parser` serves as the main component, acting as a command interpreter that directs input to the relevant classes 
(`UI`, `Storage`, `ExpenseManager`, `CategoryManager`, and `BudgetManager`).
- `UI`: Displays messages for various actions.
- `Storage`: Enhances maintainability and allows updates to data handling without distrupting the logic.
- `ExpenseManager`: Provide methods when an expense-related command is issued
- `CategoryManager`: Provide methods when an category-related command is issued
- `BudgetManager`: Provide methods when an budget-related command is issued

By centralising control, `Parser` simplifies input handling, efficiently routing and processing commands through the 
appropriate subsystems. This design fosters modularity and separation of concerns, with each class surrounding `Parser` 
dedicated to a specific role within the system. This enhances control flow and minimise direct dependencies among 
components.

Each class serves a distinct purpose and this clear division of responsibilities promotes modularity, 
making the system more adaptable and maintainable.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### TrackerData

![TrackerData Class Diagram](classdiagrams/TrackerData.drawio.png)

`TrackerData` serves as the main data structure, consolidating and managing `Category`, `Expense`, and `Budget` data 
for efficient tracking and processing within the program.
The manager classes (`ExpenseManager`, `CategoryManager`, and `BudgetManager`) are designed to interact directly with 
`TrackerData` to handle commands related to their respective domains.
- `Category`: Defines and organises each category by name, 
providing a streamlined structure for grouping expenses and budgets.
- `Expense`: Represents individual expenses, with attributes for the name, amount, and category, 
allowing categorisation of expenses and easy budget monitoring.
- `Budget`: Tracks spending limits for specific categories.
- `ExpenseManager`: Handles operations related to expenses. 
It provides methods for adding, deleting, and managing expenses within the system.
- `CategoryManager`: Manages categories, including the addition and deletion of categories. 
It works closely with `TrackerData` to ensure the appropriate category associations for expenses and budgets.
- `BudgetManager`: Handles the management of budgets, including setting and updating budget limits, 
and calculating remaining budget based on associated expenses. It operates in conjunction with `TrackerData` to 
track expenses per category.

Centralising data management in `TrackerData` and delegating specific command handling to the respective manager classes
promotes a clean separation of concerns. `TrackerData` acts as the central hub for data access and manipulation, 
ensuring a unified approach to data handling across the system. This structure simplifies data access and updates, 
while each manager class focuses on a specific domain, enhancing modularity.

This modular design allows for easy extensions and maintenance. 
Each manager is responsible for a distinct aspect of the application — expenses, categories, or budgets — encapsulating 
functionality within modules. As a result, adjustments to categories, expenses, or budgets can be made independently 
without disrupting other parts of the system, supporting a scalable and well-organized financial tracking solution.

## add-expense
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for adding a new expense in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `add-expense` command. 
For simplification, the UI package is not included.

![add-expense](sequencediagrams/AddExpense.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Input and Parsing
- The `User` provides the command `add-expense n/<name> a/<amount> c/<category>` to `SpendSwift`.
- `SpendSwift` forwards the input to the `Parser`, which calls `ExpenseManager` to handle the request.
- `ExpenseManager` uses `InputParser` to extract and validate each component (name, amount, category).

2. Validation
- If any component is missing, non-numeric, or invalid (like a negative amount), `ExpenseManager` stops and returns early.

3. Formatting and Category Management
- If the components are valid, `ExpenseManager` formats the `category` name using `Format`.
- Then, it searches for an existing category in `TrackerData`. If the category exists, it retrieves it; otherwise, it creates a new `Category`.

4. Expense Creation
- `ExpenseManager` creates an `Expense` instance with the validated name, amount, and category, then updates `TrackerData` with the new lists of expenses and categories.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## delete-expense
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for deleting an existing expense in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `delete-expense` command.

![delete-expense](sequencediagrams/DeleteExpense.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Input Parsing
- The `User` issues the command `delete-expense e/<index>` to `SpendSwift`.
- `SpendSwift` passes this input to the `Parser`, which calls `ExpenseManager` to handle the delete request.
- `ExpenseManager` uses `InputParser` to extract the expenseIndex from the input.

2. Index Validatio
- If the extracted index is invalid (e.g., non-numeric), `ExpenseManager` calls `ErrorMessage` to inform the user about the invalid input, and the process stops.

3. Expense Retrieval and Deletion
- If the index is valid, `ExpenseManager` retrieves the list of expenses from `TrackerData`.
- It checks if `expenseIndex` is within bounds of the list.

4. Error Handling and Deletion Execution
- If `expenseIndex` is out of bounds (e.g., index larger than the list size), `ErrorMessage` informs the user, and the process stops.
- If the index is within bounds, `ExpenseManager` removes the expense at `expenseIndex` and calls `SuccessMessage` to confirm the deletion to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## add-category
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for adding a new category in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `add-category` command.

![add-category](sequencediagrams/AddCategory.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. User Input and Parsing:
   - The user inputs the command `add-category c/<categoryName>`. 
   - SpendSwift receives the input and passes it to `Parser`, which then calls `addCategory` method in `CategoryManager`. 
   - `CategoryManager` delegates input parsing to `InputParser` to extract the category name from the command.

2. Validation of Category Name:
   - After parsing, `CategoryManager` checks if the `categoryName` is null or empty. If it is, an error message is displayed using `ErrorMessage`. 

3. Formatting and Duplicate Check:
   - If the `categoryName` is valid, `CategoryManager` retrieves the list of categories from `TrackerData` and formats the `categoryName` using `Format`.
   - It then iterates through the categories list, checking if a category with the same formatted name already exists. If a match is found, `SuccessMessage` is used to display a message stating that the category already exists.

4. Adding a New Category:
   - If no match is found, a new `Category` object is created with the formatted name.
   - This new category is added to the categories list, which is then saved back to `TrackerData`.
   - A success message is displayed indicating that the category was added successfully.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## delete-category
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for deleting a category with no expense tagged to it in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `delete-category` command.

![delete-category](sequencediagrams/DeleteCategory.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Input Parsing
- The `User` provides the command `delete-category c/<categoryName>` to `SpendSwift`.
- `SpendSwift` passes the input to `Parser`, which sends the delete request to `CategoryManager`.
- `CategoryManager` uses `InputParser` to extract and validate the `categoryName`.

2. Validation
- If `categoryName` is empty or missing, `CategoryManager` calls `ErrorMessage` to notify the user of the error and halts the operation.

3. Category Deletion Check
- If `categoryName` is valid, `CategoryManager` retrieves the list of categories and expenses from `TrackerData`.
- It iterates through categories to find a matching category.

4. Category Validity Check
- If `categoryName` does not match any existing category, `SuccessMessage` is called to inform the user, and the process terminates.

5. Expense Tag Check
- If the category exists, `CategoryManager` iterates over all expenses to see if any are tagged with the category.
- If an expense is associated with the category, `SuccessMessage` notifies the user that deletion isn’t possible due to tagged expenses.

6. Deletion Execution
If no expenses are tagged with the category, `CategoryManager` updates `TrackerData` by removing the category and calls `SuccessMessage` to confirm the deletion to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## tag-expense
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for tagging an expense to an existing category in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `tag-expense` command.

![tag-expenses](sequencediagrams/TagExpense.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Input Parsing
- The `User` inputs a command in the format `tag-expense e/<index> c/<category>`.
- `SpendSwift` sends this command to `Parser`, which forwards it to `ExpenseManager` to handle the tagging request.

2. Expense Index Validation
- `ExpenseManager` uses `InputParser` to parse and retrieve the `expenseIndex`.
- If the index is invalid (e.g., non-numeric or out of range), an error message is returned to the user, and the process terminates.

3. Category Name Validation
- If the index is valid, `ExpenseManager` proceeds to parse the category name.
- If the category is invalid (empty or missing), an error message is displayed, and the process terminates. 

4. Expense Tagging
- If both inputs are valid, `ExpenseManager` fetches the list of expenses and categories from `TrackerData`.
- `ExpenseManager` then formats the input category name to a standard format and searches for a matching category in categories.
- If a matching category is found, the expense is tagged with that category.
- If no match is found, an error message is displayed, notifying the user of the missing category.

5. Data Update
- After tagging, `ExpenseManager` updates the expenses list in `TrackerData` to save the changes.
- A success or error message is displayed to the user, depending on the result of the tagging operation.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## set-budget
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for setting a budget limit on an existing category in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `set-budget` command.

![set-budget](sequencediagrams/SetBudget.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Input Parsing
- The user enters a command in the format `set-budget c/<category> l/<limit>`.
- `SpendSwift` forwards this input to `Parser`, which then calls `BudgetManager` to handle the budget-setting request.

2. Category and Limit Extraction
- `BudgetManager` uses `InputParser` to extract the category and limit from the command.
- If the category is empty or the limit is invalid (not a number or negative), `BudgetManager` sends an error message, and the process ends.

3. Budget Setting Process
- If inputs are valid, `BudgetManager` formats the category name, fetches the list of categories, and checks if the specified limit exceeds a predefined maximum.
- BudgetManager then searches for a matching category within `TrackerData`'s categories.

4. Updating or Creating Budget
- If the category exists:
  - If the category already has a budget, `BudgetManager` updates the budget with the new limit.
  - Otherwise, `BudgetManager` creates a new budget instance and adds it to the budgets map in `TrackerData`.
- `SuccessMessage` displays either an update or new budget message, depending on whether the budget was modified or newly created.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## view-expenses
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for printing all the expenses by categories in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `view-expenses` command.

![view-expenses](sequencediagrams/ViewExpenses.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Command Processing
- When a user inputs the `view-expenses` command, SpendSwift forwards this input to the `Parser`.
- `Parser` then calls `ExpenseManager` to handle the `viewExpensesByCategory` request.

2. Retrieving Expenses and Categories
- `ExpenseManager` requests the list of expenses and categories from `TrackerData`.
- These lists are essential for organizing expenses by category.

3. Expense Grouping and Display
- If both the expenses and categories lists are empty, `ExpenseManager` sends a message to `SuccessMessage` to print a "No expense" message, as there are no expenses or categories to display.
- Otherwise, `SuccessMessage`:
  - Groups the expenses by their respective categories.
  - Iterates through the list of categories to display expenses associated with each category.
- For each category:
  - If it has expenses, they are printed in a structured format.
  - If it has no expenses, a "No expense" message is printed for that category.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## view-category
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for printing all the categories in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `view-category` command.

![view-category](sequencediagrams/ViewCategory.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. Command Parsing 
- When a user enters `view-category`, `SpendSwift` forwards this command to `Parser`. 
- `Parser` identifies the command and calls `CategoryManager` to handle the `viewAllCategories` action.

2. Retrieving Categories
- `CategoryManager` requests the list of categories from `TrackerData`.
- `TrackerData` returns a `List<Category>` containing all categories stored in the system.

3. Displaying Categories
- Based on the returned list:
  - If no categories are found, `CategoryManager` calls `SuccessMessage` to print a message indicating that no categories exist.
  - If categories are present, `CategoryManager` sends the list to `SuccessMessage`, which formats and prints all available categories.

4. Return Flow
- `CategoryManager` completes its task and returns control back through `Parser` to `SpendSwift`, which then completes the process.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## view-budget
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for printing all the budgets in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `view-budget` command.

![view-budget](sequencediagrams/ViewBudget.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**
1. User Input and Parsing 
- The user inputs the command `view-budget`, which is received by `SpendSwift` and passed to the `Parser` for command parsing.
- Parser then invokes `BudgetManager's viewBudget` method, providing it with the required `trackerData`.

2. Initial Checks for Budgets
- `BudgetManager` first checks if there are any budgets set in `trackerData`. If no budgets are found, a message indicating that no budgets are set is displayed using `SuccessMessage`, and the sequence ends.

3. Retrieving and Calculating Expenses by Category
- If budgets are present, `BudgetManager` retrieves the current expenses and initializes a map to track total expenses by category.
- For each expense in the list, `BudgetManager` updates the `totalExpensesToCategory` map with the expense's category and amount.

4. Calculating Remaining Budgets
- `BudgetManager` iterates through each category with a set budget. It retrieves the budget limit and calculates the remaining budget by subtracting total expenses from the budget limit.
- Based on the result, it either displays a "within budget" or "over budget" message using `SuccessMessage`.

5. Checking Categories Without Budgets
- Finally, `BudgetManager` checks if there are categories with expenses but no budget set. For each such category, it displays a message using `SuccessMessage` indicating that no budget is set.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## help
**Overview**

The sequence diagram represents the flow for printing all the help messages in SpendSwift when the user inputs an `help` command.

![help](sequencediagrams/Help.png)

**Implementation**
1. User Input and Command Parsing
- The user enters the command `help`, which is received by the `SpendSwift` system.
- `SpendSwift` forwards this command to the `Parser`, which is responsible for interpreting the user's input.

2. Displaying the Help Message
- The `Parser` recognizes the "help" command and calls the `UI` component to display a help message.
- `UI` outputs the help information to the user, listing all available commands and their expected formats.

3. Completion of Command Processing
- After displaying the help message, `UI` returns control to the `Parser`.
- The `Parser` then completes its processing, returning control to `SpendSwift`, which subsequently finishes handling the "help" command.
