## 1. Design

### 1.1 Architecture

The architecture of EasInternship is designed to follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to facilitate separation
of concerns, modularity, and maintainability.

- **View (UI)**: Responsible for interacting with the user by displaying output and reading input.
- **Controller (Command and Parser)**: Responsible for parsing user input and invoking the appropriate commands.
- **Model (InternshipList)**: Manages the state of the application, including the list of internships and tasks.
- **Storage**: Responsible for loading and saving data from and to the disk.

#### Overview

The `EasInternship` class serves as the entry point of the application. It manages the application's main loop, where
the user is continually prompted for input, and commands are processed in response. The class is responsible for
initializing the UI, loading saved data, and handling user input until the user chooses to exit the program.

#### Key Responsibilities

- **Initialization**: Initializes the necessary components for the application, such as the `Ui`, `InternshipList`, and
  `Parser` classes. It also loads any saved data from the storage into the `InternshipList`.
- **Main Loop**: Continuously prompts the user for input. The input is parsed by the `Parser`, and the corresponding
  `Command` is executed. If the user enters the exit command, the loop terminates.
- **Command Processing**: After parsing the user input, the corresponding `Command` object is executed. The application
  catches and displays any errors that occur during command execution.
- **Saving State**: Upon exiting, the current state of the `InternshipList` is saved to a file to ensure persistence
  across sessions.

---

### 1.2 UI Component

The UI component is responsible for displaying information to the user and reading input. It interacts with the user by
printing messages and prompts, and retrieves commands for the rest of the application to process.

This component comprises the following classes:
- `Ui`: Parent class with methods expect of all `Ui` subclasses.
- `UiCommand`: Has specific methods related to displaying output of commands.
- `UiInternshipList`: Handles outputs by methods in `InternshipList` class.

This is represented with the class diagram below:
![](UML/Ui_Component.png)

### 1.3 Logic Component

The logic component is handled by the `Parser` and `Command` classes. The `Parser` interprets the user's input and
returns a command object, which is then executed to perform the desired operation.

### 1.4 Model Component

The model component includes the `Internship`, `InternshipList` and `Deadline` classes.

`Internship`: Represents the individual internship entries.

`InternshipList`: Manages a collection of Internship objects, providing methods for adding, retrieving, updating,
sorting and removing internships.

`Deadline`: Represents each individual deadline associated with an internship, holding data specific to that deadline (
description, date).

Each `Internship` object contains a `Deadline` list, and has methods to add, retrieve or remove deadlines associated
with that internship.

This is represented with the class diagram below:

![](UML/Internship-Model_Component.png)

### 1.5 Storage Component

The storage component is responsible for saving the current state of the `InternshipList` to a file and loading it back
when the application is restarted. This ensures that users' progress is preserved between sessions.
The data from the internshipList is saved into a .txt file.

There are two main functions, `loadFromFile` and `saveFromFile`.

The following sequence diagrams depict how the Storage Functions work.
![](UML/loadFromFile.png)
![](UML/saveToFile.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Parsing Input

The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing the input strings provided by the user. It breaks down the input into
individual components like the command and its accompanying arguments. After parsing, it returns a `Command` object.

### 2.2 Command Execution

The `Command` class and its subclasses handle the execution of specific commands. Once a command is parsed, it is
executed with the required arguments, and the result is displayed to the user.

### 2.3 Task Management

The `InternshipList` class handles adding, removing, and retrieving internships from the list. It interacts with both
the UI and the storage components to ensure that updates are reflected in the user interface and persisted to disk.

---

### Flow of Execution

1. **Welcome Message**: The `Ui` class displays a welcome message to the user.
2. **Load Data**: The `Storage` class loads any saved internships into the `InternshipList`.
3. **Input Loop**: The application enters a loop, prompting the user for input.
4. **Command Parsing**: The `Parser` interprets the input and returns the appropriate `Command`.
5. **Command Execution**: The command is executed, and the `InternshipList` is updated accordingly.
6. **Exit Flow**: If the user enters the exit command, the `InternshipList` is saved, and the application displays a
   goodbye message.

### Methods

- `public static void main(String[] args)`: The entry point of the application. It handles initialization, the main user
  input loop, and command execution.

### Error Handling

If the user inputs an unknown command or a command fails during execution, the `Ui` class displays an appropriate error
message. This ensures that the application can continue running despite errors in user input.

### AddCommand Implementation

#### Overview:

The `AddCommand` class is responsible for adding internship listings to the Internship List. It extends the `Command`
class, providing the add functionality as part of the command execution framework.

#### Design:

- The `AddCommand` class processes user input to determine what fields to add to the new internship listing.
- If no arguments or invalid arguments are given, it prompts the user with an error message indicating which fields are
  erroneous.

#### Key Methods:

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: Handles addition logic based on the inputs provided. If the user provides an
  appropriate "role" and "company", the internship is added to the listing. Otherwise, the user is prompted with which
  fields are missing. The user also can input start and end dates of the internship during the addition.
- **`getUsage()`**: Returns a string showing the correct usage of the `add` command and the expected input.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

- The user enters `add -role Software Engineer -company Google`, and the execute method adds the internship to the
  InternshipList The start and end dates are defaulted to 01/01.


- The user enters `add -role Software Engineer -company Facebook -from 10/24 -to 06/25`, and the execute method adds the
  internship with the specified dates to the InternshipList.


- The user enters `add -role Software Engineer`. The execute method detects that no company has been specified and adds
  `company` to the list of invalid flags. uiCommand is then called and prints an error statement of all invalid flags
  detected.

#### Sequence Diagram:

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AddCommand` is executed:
![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](UML/AddCommand_Sequence_Diagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### DeleteCommand Implementation

#### Overview:

The `DeleteCommand` class is responsible for deleting internship listings from the Internship List. It extends the
`Command` class, providing the delete functionality as part of the command execution framework.

#### Design:

- The `DeleteCommand` class processes user input to determine which `Internship` to remove from the `InternshipList`.
- If no arguments or invalid arguments are given, it prompts the user with an error message indicating which fields are
  erroneous.

#### Key Methods:

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)` : Handles deletion logic based on the inputs provided. If the user provides an
  appropriate `internshipID`, the `Internship` is deleted from the `InternshipList`. Otherwise, if an inappropriate or
  no `internshipID` is specified, the user is prompted that the `internshipID` is invalid.


- `getUsage()`: Returns a string showing the correct usage of the `delete` command and the expected input.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

- The user enters `delete 1`. The execute method removes the `Internship` from the `InternshipList` if the
  `internshipID` is valid.
- The user enters `delete -1`. The execute method detects that the `internshipID` is invalid. uiCommand is called and
  prints an output `Invalid integer, please provide a valid internship ID`.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeleteCommand` is executed:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### SortCommand Implementation

#### Overview:

The `SortCommand` class is responsible for sorting the internship listings based on different criteria such as the
internship role, skills and status (alphabetically) , the application deadline (by start and end dates). It extends the
`Command` class, providing the sorting functionality as part of the command execution framework. It can only sort by
exactly one field in each time.

#### Design:

- The `SortCommand` class processes user input to determine which sorting method to apply (e.g., role or deadline).
- If no arguments or invalid arguments are given, it defaults to listing internships by ID.

#### Key Methods:

- **`execute(ArrayList<String> args)`**: Handles sorting logic based on the first argument provided. The valid sort
  options include:
    - `"role"`: Sorts internships by role alphabetically.
    - `"duration"`: Sorts internships by duration (start and end dates).
    - `"deadline"`: Sorts internships by deadline.
    - `"skills"`: Sorts internships by the first skill in the skills list alphabetically.
    - `"status"`: Sort internships by status, (application pending, application completed, accepted, rejected) with this
      ascending order. Within the same status, the order is sorted by role.
    - `"company"`: Sorts internships by company alphabetically.
    - `"role in favourite"`: Sorts internships in favourite by role alphabetically.
    - `"duration in favourite"`: Sorts internships in favourite by duration (start and end dates).
    - `"deadline in favourite"`: Sorts internships in favourite by deadline.
    - `"skills in favourite"`: Sorts internships in favourite by the first skill in the skills list alphabetically.
    - `"status in favourite"`: Sort internships in favourite by status, (application pending, application completed,
      accepted, rejected) with this ascending order. Within the same status, the order is sorted by role.
    - `"company in favourite"`: Sorts internships in favourite by company alphabetically.
- If the user provides an invalid sort option, the command returns an error and defaults to listing internships by ID.
- **`getUsage()`**: Returns a string showing the correct usage of the `sort` command, including valid options like "
  alphabet", "deadline", "duration", "skills", and "status".

#### Example Usage Scenario:

1. The user enters `sort -role`, and the `execute` method sorts the internships by role alphabetically.
2. The user enters `sort -duration`, and the internships are sorted by their start and end dates.
3. The user enters `sort -skills`, and the internships are sorted by the first skill alphabetically.
4. The user enters `sort -status`, and the internships are sorted by status, (application pending, application
   completed, accepted, rejected) with this ascending order. Within the same status, the order is sorted by role.
5. The user enters `sort -deadline`, and the internships are sorted by each of their earliest deadline.
6. The user enters `sort -company`, and the internships are sorted by their company alphabetically.
7. The user enters `sort -role in favourite`, and the `execute` method sorts the internships in favourite by role.
8. The user enters `sort -duration  in favourite`, and the internships in favourite are sorted by their start and end
   dates.
9. The user enters `sort -skills in favourite`, and the internships in favourite are sorted by status, (application
   pending, application completed, accepted, rejected) with this ascending order. Within the same status, the order is
   sorted by role.
10. The user enters `sort -status in favourite`, and the internships in favourite are sorted by their status
    alphabetically.
11. The user enters `sort -deadline in favourite`, and the internships in favourite are sorted by each of their earliest
    deadline.
12. The user enters `sort -company in favourite`, and the internships in favourite are sorted by their company
    alphabetically.
13. If the user enters an invalid sort option, the command returns an error and lists the internships by ID.

### FilterCommand Implementation

#### Overview:

The FilterCommand class is responsible for filtering internship listings in the InternshipList based on various
criteria. It extends the Command class, providing the filter functionality as part of the command execution framework.

#### Design:

The FilterCommand class processes user input to determine which fields to filter by (e.g., role, company, start date,
end date and/or favourite status) and then filters the internships based on the respective fields.

Role and Company: Filters internships by checking the equality of the given role or company name against each
internship's role or company name

Start Date (-from) and End Date (-to): Filters internships by checking if the internship's duration is within the time
interval specified by the start and end dates. if no -to flag is provided, all internships whose start date is greater
than or equal to the given start date is listed. If no -from flag is provided, all internships whose end date is lesser
than or equal to the given end date is listed.

Favourite: Filters internships based on whether or not they are marked as a favourite (true or false).

If an invalid flag, empty or invalid fields are provided, it prompts the user with an error message indicating which
flags/fields are missing or erroneous.

#### Key Methods:

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: Handles filtering logic based on the arguments provided. The command allows the user to
filter internships by different criteria such as role, company, start date, end date and/or favourite status. If the
arguments are invalid or missing, the user is notified accordingly.
- `executeFilterByOneFlag(String[] words)`: Processes a single filter criterion (flag and its value) and applies the corresponding filter to the internships list. If the flag is invalid or the value is missing, the user is notified.
- `filterByRespectiveFlag(String flag, InternshipFieldGetter getter, String searchTerm)`: Determines which specific filter method to invoke based on the provided flag and delegates the filtering operation.
- `filterByRoleAndCompany(InternshipFieldGetter getter, String inputValue)`: Filters internships by matching the role or company field with the input value provided by the user.
- `filterByFavouriteInternships(String inputFavouriteStatus)`: Filters internships based on whether they are marked as favourites or not, according to the user's input ("true" or "false"). If the input is invalid, the user is notified.
- `filterByDate(InternshipFieldGetter getter, String inputDate, BiPredicate<YearMonth, YearMonth> dateComparator)`: Filters internships based on the start date ("-from") or end date ("-to"), comparing the internship's date with the input date using the provided date comparator.
#### Example Usage Scenario:

The user enters `filter -role Software Engineer`, and the `execute` method calls the `executeFilterByOneFlag` which
validates the role flag and calls the `filterByRespectiveFlag` method. This then calls the `filterByRoleAndCompany`
method
which removes all internships whose role field is not equal to the string "Software Engineer" and finally the control is
handed back to the `execute` method which displays the filtered list of internships

The user enters `filter -favourite true`, and the execute method filters internships that have been marked as favourites

The user enters `filter -from 06/24`, and the execute method filters internships starting from June 2024

The user enters `filter -role Software Engineer -from 02/24 -to 08/24`, the execute method filters internships whose
duration is within the period of 02/24 to 08/24 and which has the role of "Software Engineer"

The user enters `filter -favourite false -company Huawei`, the execute method filters internships from "Huawei" and
which have not been marked as favourite by the user

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `FilterCommand` is executed:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### FavouriteCommand Implementation

#### Overview
The FavouriteCommand class allows users to add internships to their list of favourite internships. It extends the Command class, providing the functionality to mark internships as favourites within the application. This feature helps users to quickly access and manage internships they are particularly interested in.

#### Design

- User Input Processing: The `FavouriteCommand` processes user input to determine which internships to mark as favourites based on their IDs.
- Validation: It validates the provided internship IDs to ensure they correspond to existing internships in the `InternshipList`. If an invalid integer or ID is provided, it informs the user accordingly.
- Favourite Internships Management: The command interacts with the `InternshipList` to add the specified internships to the user's list of favourite internships. It checks for duplicates to prevent the same internship from being added multiple times to the favourites list.

#### Key Methods

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: The main method that handles the addition of internships to the favourites list based on the provided IDs. It performs validation and updates the InternshipList accordingly.
- `getInputInternships(ArrayList<String> args)`: Parses the list of input IDs and retrieves the corresponding Internship objects from the InternshipList. It throws exceptions if any IDs are invalid or out of bounds.
- `getUsage()`: Returns a string showing the correct usage of the favourite command, guiding users on how to use the command properly.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

1. Adding Single Internship to Favourites: The user enters `favourite 2`
   - Execution:
       The execute method is called with args containing "2".
       getInputInternships() retrieves the internship with ID 2.
       The internship is added to the favourites list.
       A message confirming the addition is displayed to the user.

2. Adding Multiple Internships to Favourites: The user enters `favourite 1,3,5`
   - Execution:
       The execute method is called with args containing "1", "3", "5".
       getInputInternships retrieves internships with IDs 1, 3, and 5.
       Each internship is checked for duplication and added to the favourites list.
       Messages confirming the additions are displayed to the user.

3. Attempting to Add an Invalid Internship ID: The user enters `favourite 10`
   - Execution:
       The execute method is called with args containing "10".
       getInputInternships attempts to retrieve an internship with ID 10.
       An InvalidIndex exception is thrown as there is no internship with ID 10.
       The exception message is displayed to the user.
   
4. Adding an Internship Already in Favourites: The user enters `favourite 2`
   - Execution:
   The execute method is called with args containing "2".
   getInputInternships retrieves the internship with ID 2.
   The internship is found to already be in the favourites list.
   A message indicating that the internship is already favourited is displayed.

#### Sequence Diagram

providing an updating functionality as part of the command execution framework.

#### Design

- The `UpdateCommand` class processes the user input to determine which internship and which field to update.
- If the internship ID is not valid, it will print a message accordingly.
- If the field is not valid, it will print a message indicating the erroneous field.
- If the value provided with the field is not valid, it will also print a message indicating the erroneous value.

#### Key Methods

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: Handles the logic to find the internship entry and determine which field to update.
  The valid fields include:
    - `status`: Updates the status of the internship.
    - `skills`: Adds skills to the relevant field of the internship
    - `role`: Updates the role of the internship
    - `company`: Updates the company of the internship
    - `from`: Updates the start date of the internship
    - `to`: Updates the end date of the internship
    - `deadlines`: Updates the deadlines of the internship
- `isValidValue(String[] words)`: Checks if there was a new value provided for the selected field.
- `updateOneField(String[] words, int internshipIndex)`: Called within `execute(args)` to invoke the appropriate method to update the field.
- `getUsage()`: Returns a `String` showing the correct usage of the `update` command.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

- The user enters `update 2 -status Application Completed`, and the `execute` method finds the internship with ID `2`
  and updates its `status` to `Application Completed`.
- The user enters `update 4 -status Application Completed`, if `4` is not a valid ID, the `execute` method will print a
  message to show the ID is out of bounds.
- The user enters `update 2 -skills`, no value is given after the `-skills` flag, the `isValidValue` method returns
  false and prints a message to indicate the need for a value.
- The user enters `update 2 -from Tomorrow`, `Tomorrow` is not a valid date, the `execute` method prints message to
  indicate it is an invalid value.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UpdateCommand` is executed:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### RemoveCommand Implementation

#### Overview

The `RemoveCommand` class is responsible for removing the values within fields of an internship entry. It extends the
`UpdateCommand` class, providing a removing functionality to the execution framework.

#### Design
- The `RemoveCommand` class processes the user input to determine which internship and which field to empty.
- If the internship ID is not valid, it will print a message accordingly.
- If the field is not valid, it will print a message indicating the erroneous field, including fields that cannot be
  emptied.
- If the valid provided does not exist in the field, it will also print a message indicating the erroneous value

#### Key Methods

- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: Handles the logic to find the internship entry (same as `UpdateCommand`) and
  determine which field to update. The valid fields include:
    - `skills`: Removes the specific value from the skills field of the internship
    - `deadline`: Removes the specified deadline from the internship.
- `isValidValue(String[] words)`: Checks if there is a value provided to search and remove from the selected field.
- `updateOneField(String[] words, int internshipIndex)`: Called within `execute(args)` to invoke the appropriate method to remove the value from the field.
- `getUsage()`: Returns a `String` showing the correct usage of the `remove` command.

#### Example Usage Scenario:

- The user enters `remove 2 -skills Python`, the `execute` method finds the internship with ID `2` and removes `Python`
  from its list of `skills`.
- The user enters `remove 4 -skills Python`, if `4` is not a valid ID, the `execute` method will print a message to show
  the ID is out of bounds.
- The user enters `remove 2 -skills`, no value is given after the `-skills` flag, the `isValidValue` method returns
  false and prints a message to indicate the need for a value.
- The user enters `remove 2 -skills Accounting`, if `Accounting` is not listed in `skills`, the `execute` method prints
  a message to indicate the value cannot be found.

### CalendarCommand Implementation

#### Overview

The `CalendarCommand` class is responsible for sorting and displaying all deadlines in chronological order. It extends the `Command` class, providing a calendar functionality in the execution framework.

#### Design
- The `CalendarCommand` class does not process any input data and will execute the same method when called.

#### Key Methods
- `execute(ArrayList<String> args)`: Handles invoking methods to compile deadline data and display the data.
- `getDeadlines()`: Returns all the deadlines of all `Internship` entries, compiled into a single `ArrayList`.
- `sortDeadlines(ArrayList<Deadline> deadlines)`: Returns the deadlines sorted in ascending order chronologically.
- `getCompanies(ArrayList<Deadline> sortedDeadlins)`: Returns an `ArrayList` of the companies associated to each deadline after sorting. It is meant to ensure the methods called in `UiCommand` do not have to reference `InternshipList` to find the appropriate data.
- `getUsage()`: Returns a `String` showing the correct usage of the `Calendar` command.

#### Example Usage Scenario:
- The user enters `calendar`, the `execute` method will sort the deadlines and display them to the user.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Usability: The command-line interface should be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.
2. Reliability: The application should not lose any user data during normal operation or unexpected shutdowns.
3. Compatibility: The application should run on common operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
4. Maintainability: The code should be well-documented and follow clean code principles for easy future enhancements.
5. Portability: User data should be easily exportable and importable for backup purposes or switching devices.
6. Performance: The application should respond to all user commands without negatively noticable delay.
7. Scalability: The application should handle an extensive number of internship entries (e.g., 100+ entries) without a
   noticeable decrease in performance.
8. Data Persistence: All data should be automatically saved to a file, allowing users to resume their progress upon
   reopening the application.
