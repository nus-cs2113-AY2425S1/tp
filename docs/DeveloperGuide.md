## Design & implementation
The overall project is structured into six packages:
- Command: Classes used for abstracting user commands
- Core: Core classes
- Exceptions: Customized exceptions
- Recommender: TBD 
- Services: Key logic and services that make use of core classes
- Utils: Helper functions

### High Level Class Design
The main classes of this implementation are:
- HealthMate
- ChatParser
- User
- MealList
- MealEntriesList
- Meal
- MealEntry
- HistoryTracker
- UI

In each class we focused on maintaining a tight abstraction barrier between classes.
This specifically includes adherance to the "Tell Don't Ask" principle which was enforced by
making most attributes of all classes above private and avoiding getter methods if possible.
The following diagram illustrates the resulting associations, methods and attributes.
For the sake of clarity, classes which are not central corner stones for a high-level overview are ommitted.

#### HealthMate
Entry point to the application is the main function of HealthMate.
The HealthMate class contains a private ChatParser attribute. This attribute's run function initiates, 
after an initial greeting to the user, the interaction process. In this process, 
the user enters commands with additional information into his command line application.
The content of these commands is parsed by the ChatParser. 

#### ChatParser
The ChatParser class, instantiated once per application run, manages HealthMates overal usage 
flow through its main run() method. 

It has two primary attributes: 
- A `MealEntriesList` object called `mealEntries` 
  - Contains tracked calorie consumption 
- A `MealList` object called `mealOptions` 
  - Contains meals that are presaved by the user for quick selection to track commonly consumed meals
  - the command `meal menu` is used to display the current mealOptions. The implementation of this command is shown in the UML diagram below.
![Meal Menu SD](images/mealMenuSD.png)

These objects represent the application's underlying data with which the user interacts through the command line.
To ensure no unintended changes are done, the ChatParser class orchestrates the effects of the users prompts.
For saving these changes the ChatParser class makes use the `HistoryTracker`  which facilitates the process of 
storing (and loading) User data, mealEntries data and mealOptions data to their corresponding files. 

More details on the implementation of ChatParser follows in the Feature Section. 

#### MealList
The MealList class contains a private ArrayList of Meal object.
Further, it encapsulates behaviour to operate on this list of meals. Most notably, 
this adding or deleting a Meal to/from the list. 

#### MealEntriesList
The MealEntriesList class extends the MealList class. It overwrites the extractAndAppendMeal(...) method,
and additionally includes methods specifically tailored to providing helpul user feedback, as the MealEntries stored 
within its instance, signify the users calorie consumption. 
As a MealEntry object differs from a Meal object by the additional timestamp attribute, this includes
computations based on the time dimension. More specifically, the printDaysConsumptionBar() uses the UIs class'
methods in the background to visualize the percentage of a certain days total consumption versus the idaeal consumption
of a User class. 

#### Meal
The Meal class encapsulates the concept of a meal. As the purpose of this application 
is to track calorie consumption, this consists of a mandatory calorie entry. The meal's name attribute, 
is however an Optional<String> allowing a case, where no meaningful label can be attached to a certain consumption.
![User SD](images/addMeal.svg)

#### MealEntry
The MealEntry class extends the meal class and contains an additional field timestamp. 
This distinction was made, as objects of the Meal class will represent possible meal options to choose form, 
while a mealEntry is a concrete calorie consumption the user wants to track. The latter makes a timestamp indispensible. 

#### HealthGoal
The HealthGoal class manages a user's health goal and calculates target calorie intake based on user data such as height, weight, age, and gender. 
It offers three main health goals: weight loss, steady state, and bulking, each with a corresponding calorie modification factor. 
The class supports setting, storing, and retrieving the health goal. 
Additionally, it provides a method to compute target calories using the Harris-Benedict Equation, modified by the current health goal. 
This allows the class to adapt the calorie calculations according to the user's health objectives, making it versatile for various fitness plans.

This is a condensed diagram on how the HealthGoal class interacts with other Classes:
![HealtGoal CD](images/HealthGoalClassDiagram.png)

The implementation of setting of a healthGoal with a String input for example is shown below:

![Set Health Goal SD](images/setHealthGoalSD.png)

#### User
The user class encapsulates all necessary information for computing an ideal daily calorie consumption. 
This includes:
- Height (in cm): Double 
- Weight (in cm): Double
- Age: Integer
- Gender: Boolean
- Health goal: HealthGoal
- Ideal calorie intake: Computed based on the information above 
- Date: LocalDateTime specifying the date of the above information
More details follow in the Features section of this guide. 

#### HistoryTracker
The HistoryTracker class is responsible for managing the persistence of data in the HealthMate application. It handles the saving and loading of user data, meal entries, and meal options to and from files. This class plays a crucial role in maintaining the application's state across different sessions.

Key features of the HistoryTracker class include:

1. Data Persistence:
   - Saves user data, meal entries, and meal options to separate files.
   - Loads existing data from these files when a new usage session is initiated.

2. File Management:
   - Creates and manages the necessary files for storing application data.
   - Handles file I/O operations, ensuring data integrity during read and write processes.

3. Data Formatting:
   - Converts complex objects (like User, MealEntry, and Meal) into a format suitable for file storage.
   - Deserializes stored data back into usable objects when loading the application state.

HistoryTracker allows for the persistance of user inputted data between sessions by storing it in a local csv file.

## Features

This section will document the contributions made by each team member regarding the implementation or planned feature enhancements, detailing the design and thought processes behind them.

### Creating a User Profile
To create or load a user profile the `UserHistoryTracker` class provides the method `checkForUserData` which loads 
saved user information if available from an existing file or prompts the user
to input new information for creating a new profile as shown in the sequence diagram below.

### ChatParser Input Handling
The 'ChatParser' class has the responsibility of parsing user input to steer the 
application logic based on predefined commands specified in the `CommandMap' class.
Therefore, the ChatParser class acts as the main interface between user input and command execution. 
This includes extracting and routing commands, as well as exception handling for 
false input. 

#### Feature Implementation
The `ChatParser class:`
1. Accepts user input. I.e. it reads input from the command line
2. Tokenizes commands and identifys one- and two-token commands
3. Routes commands based on the identified command tokens which are specified in the `CommandMap` class. This is done 
using methods such as `multiCommandParsing` for 2-token commands and `run` which encapsulates the main loop of
user interaction until the exit command "bye" terminates the application.
4. Logs command routing and its effects on a high level to enable tracking of the application's activity.

#### Why It Is Implemented This Way
The ChatParser class was implemented in the above manner for three reasons:
1. It allows create one abstract unit for handling the responsibility of orchestrating usage flow.
2. As a high-level abstraction layer it improves readability by bundliing the overall application logic in one place.
3. Its modularity allows for easy extensions or modifications to `CommandMap` and `multiCommandParsing`. 

#### Alternatives considered
Direct command handling in the main loop. Reduces the depth of the application, 
but comes at the cost of reduced readability and higher cohesion. 

#### Future additions
Separating the responsibilities of reading and preprocessing user input from the responsibility 
to steer command routing. This could improve the maintainability of the ChatParser class in the future. 

### Command Handling with CommandMap Class

#### Overview

The `CommandMap` feature enhances the system's command handling by centralizing the lookup, and
storage of commands. It allows users to efficiently view commands usage within the HealthMate application.

#### Feature Implementation

The `CommandMap` class in the `seedu.healthmate.command` package maps command names to their corresponding
`Command` objects using a `HashMap<String, Command>`. This ensures fast retrieval and allows users to explore
commands with ease.

#### Why It Is Implemented This Way

Using a `HashMap` allows efficient command lookups with a constant time complexity of O(1). Centralizing all
commands within `CommandMap` simplifies the system's command handling process and makes it more maintainable  as new
commands are added.

#### Alternatives Considered

An alternative was storing commands in a list and iterating through them sequentially to find the matching command.
However, this approach was less efficient for frequent lookups compared to the `HashMap`.

#### Proposed additions for future

The `CommandMap` can be built upon to support saving and usage of user created scripts as commands. For example
using a user could possibly create an add morningRoutine command by creating a command that runs multiple add
mealEntry commands of their regular breakfast as well as triggering the updateUser data command.

#### Sequence Diagram

### Delete Meal and MealEntry Commands

#### Overview

The `delete` commands allow users to be able to delete any `meal` or `mealEntry` they may have put in.
It allows users to be able to delete any erroneous entry they may have put in.

#### Feature Implementation

The `delete meal` and `delete mealEntry` Commands are classes in the `seedu.healthmate.command` package.
When called by the user from ChatParser the `executeCommand` method will be called 
executing the command as necessary.
This is also how all other commands are executed.

To delete a `meal` or `mealEntry` the respective index of it must be included after the command.

#### Why It Is implemented This Way

Inline with the `Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)` the execution commands were abstracted 
and were put into the respective Commands. This allowed for neater and more readable code while also
allowing for less nesting inline with the `SLAP Principle`.

The index of `meal` or `mealEntry` was used to delete it as it had less edge cases while also being
more consistent from the user's point of view.

#### Alternatives Considered

Initially the code to execute the commands were in the `ChatParser` class but this made it messy and 
caused a lot of unnecessary nesting. Debugging the `ChatParser` class was also much harder due to this.
Therefore, the execution code and it's helper functions were shifted to the various command classes.

The deletion of a `meal` option by using it's name was also considered. However this was found to be
less intuitive from a user point of view. Some larger `meal` names (eg. `Hawaiian Pizza with Mushrooms`)
may be harder for the user to input correctly in order to delete. From a usability perspective, 
just requiring the index makes it simpler for the user.

#### Future Additions

A find command could be implemented that could help users find the index and details of 
the `meal` or `mealEntry` that they would like to delete. Would be helpful for the user as
too many entries may make it hard for the user to find the one they would like to delete.
