### Software Architecture
![Archi_Architecture.png](Images/Archi_Architecture.png)

The Architecture Diagram shown above depicts the high-level design of the FitTrack CLI application.

**FitTrack** is the main class and entry point of the application. It manages high level functionalities by coordinating the four main classes:

| Class           | Functionality                                                                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storage         | Manages saving and loading data from a persistent storage file                                               |
| User            | Records the user’s information, such as age and gender, and provides methods to modify or retrieve this data |
| Parser          | Handles parsing of user input, converting it into commands and actions                                       |
| Ui              | Handles user interaction and CLI output, printing messages and data to the console                           |

**Commons** and **Exceptions** represent a collection of lower level Classes and Exceptions used by the main classes above.
**Commons** classes are as follows:

| Class             | Functionality                                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FitTrackLogger    | Manages logging for the application, ensuring errors and important events are properly recorded                 |
| TrainingSession   | Represents a single training session, including exercises and metadata (e.g. date and description)              |
| Exercise          | Represents different types of exercises available in the application, like pull-ups or shuttle runs             |
| Calculator        | Look up points achieved by user based on age, gender and performance result of each exercise station            |
| GraphPoints       | Illustrates the cumulative points earned across sessions, showcasing overall fitness progress and achievements. |
| GraphPerformance  | Visualises performance metrics for a specific exercise, adapting for time-based or rep-based tracking.          |
| Reminder          | Allows users to set reminders to be track deadlines and upcoming events.                                        |
| Goal              | Allows users to set, list, and delete specific goals related to fitness and overall well-being                  |
| FoodWaterIntake   | Allows users to add, view, and delete water and food intake logs to monitor daily hydration levels              |

The following Class Diagram elaborates on the interactions between major classes and their multiplicities.

### Overall Class Diagram

## Features

### Storage
### Storage Overview

The `Storage` class handles the reading and writing of data for the application, interacting with various objects such 
as `TrainingSession`, `Goal`, `Reminder`, `FoodEntry`, and `WaterEntry`. The data is saved in a file located at 
`data/saveFile.txt`, with functionality to initialize the save file, load data from it, and update the file with the 
latest information. Below is a breakdown of the methods used for these tasks:

![Class_Storage.png](Images/Class_Storage.png)

#### 1. Initializing the Save File
The `initialiseSaveFile()` method ensures that the necessary directory and save file exist. If the "data" directory or 
"saveFile.txt" file is not found, the method attempts to create them. If successful, a message is logged confirming the 
creation of the new save file or the access to an existing one. This method also asserts that the file exists after the 
initialization.

- **Helper Functions:**
   - `Files.createDirectories(dirPath)`: Creates the necessary directory for the save file.
   - `file.createNewFile()`: Creates the save file if it doesn't already exist.

#### 2. Loading the Save File
The `loadSaveFile(ArrayList<Saveable> loadList)` method reads the save file and populates the provided list (`loadList`)
with objects that are deserialized from the file. It uses a `Scanner` to read the file line by line. Each line 
corresponds to a serialized object (such as `TrainingSession`, `Goal`, or `Reminder`), and the method delegates the 
parsing to the `createSaveableFromString(String saveString)` method, which identifies the type of object based on the 
prefix of the line.

- **Helper Functions:**
   - `createSaveableFromString(String saveString)`: This method inspects the prefix of each line in the save file and 
   - creates the appropriate object by invoking the `fromSaveString` method of the corresponding class 
   - (e.g., `TrainingSession.fromSaveString(saveString)`).
   - `Scanner`: Reads the file content line by line.

#### 3. Updating the Save File
The `updateSaveFile()` method writes the latest data to the save file. It serializes objects from the provided lists 
(`sessionList`, `goalList`, `reminderList`, and `foodWaterList`) and writes each object’s string representation to the 
save file. It ensures that the lists are non-null before attempting to write, and for each object, it calls the 
`toSaveString()` method to retrieve the string representation. After each entry, a newline is added to separate entries.
The method uses `FileWriter` to perform the writing operation.

- **Helper Functions:**
   - `toSaveString()`: Called for each object to retrieve its serialized string representation.
   - `FileWriter`: Writes the serialized data to the save file.

#### 4. Error Handling and Logging
Throughout these operations, appropriate error handling is implemented. If the save file cannot be found or created, or 
if an invalid data format is encountered during loading, an exception is thrown or logged. For instance, 
`InvalidSaveDataException` is thrown if an unrecognized descriptor is found in the save file. Additionally, the 
`LOGGER` object is used extensively to log the success or failure of various operations, providing insight into the 
application's file handling processes.

### Sequence of Events for Each Operation

1. **Initialization of Save File:**
   - The method checks for the existence of the directory and file.
   - If they do not exist, it creates them and logs the event.
   - If successful, the method ensures the file exists with an assertion.

2. **Loading Data from Save File:**
   - The method initializes a `Scanner` to read the save file.
   - For each line, it calls `createSaveableFromString()` to convert the line into an appropriate object.
   - Each object is added to the `loadList`.
   - On success, a message is logged indicating successful loading.

3. **Saving Data to File:**
   - The method iterates through each list (`sessionList`, `goalList`, `reminderList`, `foodWaterList`).
   - For each object in the list, it calls `toSaveString()` to convert the object to a string representation.
   - The string is written to the save file using `FileWriter`.
   - After each entry, a newline character is added.
   - The process concludes with a log indicating that the file has been successfully updated.

This system provides an efficient and reliable way to persist and retrieve application data, ensuring data integrity and
ease of maintenance.



### Set User
When the application starts up, it will prompt the user for their gender and age via the Set User feature.
Their input is processed by Parser and stored in a newly created instance of the User class, which is assigned to the 
object "user".
Upon successful setting of the gender and age fields, a confirmation of the user's gender and age will be printed in the
CLI via the Ui class.

If the user wants to update their age or gender after the initialization process, they can set it again at any time by 
calling the "set" command.
This performs the same operations, re-instantiating the "user" object with a new User instance with the updated details.

The sequence diagram for this process is shown below. 

[//]: # (![Class_SetUser.png]&#40;Images/Class_SetUser.png&#41;)

![Sequence_SetUser.png](Images/Sequence_SetUser.png)

### Add Training Session

[//]: # (![Class_AddTrainingSession.png]&#40;Images/Class_AddTrainingSession.png&#41;)

#### 1. Class Interaction Overview
When the user adds a new training session, an instance of the `TrainingSession` class is created. 
This instance initializes an EnumMap, which instantiates the 6 `ExerciseStation` child classes with 
their initial values.
Below is a class diagram showing the EnumMap after an instance of `TrainingSession` is created.

![Class_TrainingSessionInitialState.png](Images/Class_TrainingSessionInitialState.png)

#### 2. Sequence of Events

![Sequence_addTrainingSession.png](Images/Sequence_addTrainingSession.png)

1) **User inputs the add command**: The User initiates the "add <name of the training session>" command by 
   calling Parser with the appropriate input.
2) **Instantiation of TrainingSession**: The Parser creates a new TrainingSession object with the 
   current time, description, and user.
3) **Instantiation of Exercise Stations**: Within TrainingSession class, all 6 subclasses of exercise
   stations are instantiated.
4) **UI Interaction**: The Parser calls Ui.printAddedSession(sessionList), which:
   (i) Begins a UI segment
   (ii) Prints a session message
   (iii) Prints the description of the last added session
   (iv) Calls printSessionCount to show the total count
   (v) Ends the segment.
5) Refer to Section on Edit Exercise and Point Calculation for specific implementation of 
   performance metric and point conversion.

### Modify the DateTime of a Training Session
When Parser detects the "modify" command, the TrainingSession instance at the user's specified index in sessionList will
be overwritten with the new DateTime as specified by the user via the setDateTime function call.

![Sequence_ModifyTrainingSession.png](Images/Sequence_ModifyTrainingSession.png)

### Delete Training Session
When Parser detects the "delete" command, the TrainingSession instance at the user's specified index in sessionList will
 be copied into a new private TrainingSession instance called sessionToDelete. The original instance in sessionList will 
then be deleted. The new private instance is used to print the details of the deleted session, giving the user 
confirmation that the TrainingSession they wished to delete has been successfully deleted. The new TrainingSession
instance is then disposed of.

[//]: # (![Class_DeleteTrainingSession.png]&#40;Images/Class_DeleteTrainingSession.png&#41;)

![Sequence_DeleteTrainingSession.png](Images/Sequence_DeleteTrainingSession.png)

### List Training Sessions
When Parser detects the "list" command, it calls printSessionList() followed by printSessionCount().
printSessionList() first checks if sessionList is empty. If sessionList is empty, it prints a message saying so.
If sessionList is not empty, it will be iterated through. 
For each TrainingSession in sessionList, getSessionDescription will be called, returning its details as a String.
The TrainingSession's index will be printed, followed by the session description before iterating to the next index.
When all the TrainingSessions have been printed, Ui calls printSessionCount() to display the total number of 
TrainingSessions in sessionList.

[//]: # (![Class_ListTrainingSessions.png]&#40;Images/Class_ListTrainingSessions.png&#41;)

![Sequence_ListTrainingSessions.png](Images/Sequence_ListTrainingSessions.png)

### View Training Session
When Parser detects the "view" command, it calls printSessionView() on the user's specified session index.
This in turn calls viewSession(), which outputs the details of the TrainingSession instance in the CLI.
This process fetches the details of each of the 6 ExerciseStation classes, which fetch details from the Calculator 
classes.
These details are then printed to the CLI.

[//]: # (![Class_ViewTrainingSession.png]&#40;Images/Class_ViewTrainingSession.png&#41;)

![Sequence_ViewTrainingSession.png](Images/Sequence_ViewTrainingSession.png)

### Edit Exercise

The **Edit Exercise** feature is managed by the `TrainingSession` class, and is primarily carried out by its 
`editExercise()` function. This feature utilizes the `setPerformance()`and `getPoints()` methods from the 
`ExerciseStation` classes to edit the performance for the user’s selected 
exercises. Additionally, it calculates the points the user will earn for each exercise based on the updated performance
values.

When the user wishes to edit a training session, they specify an `Exercise` Enum, and the reps/timing to be inputted.
These variables are then passed to the`editExercise` function. This function calls the relevant methods to update the 
repetitions or timings and calculates the corresponding points for the specified exercise.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the function calls involved in this process:

![Sequence_editExercise.png](Images/Sequence_editExercise.png)

Additionally, the state diagram below shows the end state of the `editExercise` function after execution of the command,
`editExercise(Exercise.PULL_UP, 1)` and `editExercise(Exercise.SHUTTLE_RUN, "16.0")`:

![Class_TrainingSessionEditState.png](Images/Class_TrainingSessionEditState.png)

### Add Reminder
When a user inputs the command to add a new reminder (`remind <description> <deadline>`), the process begins by parsing 
the input to separate the `description` and `deadline`. The description and deadline are split using the `//` delimiter.
If the input does not adhere to the expected format an error message is displayed, and the process is halted. Both the 
description and deadline are then validated; if either is empty or invalid, an exception is thrown, and an appropriate 
error message is shown to the user.

Once the input is validated, the deadline is parsed into a `LocalDateTime` object using the parseDeadline method. If 
the deadline format is incorrect, a `DateTimeParseException` is caught, and an error message is displayed. 

Following successful validation, a new `Reminder` object is created using the validated information and constructor of the Reminder class.

The newly created Reminder object is then added to the `reminderList`, which is maintained by the `:FitTrack` class. 
After the reminder is added, the `printAddedReminder()` method is invoked to display the reminder’s details to the 
user. Finally, the `updateSaveFile` method is called within the Parser class, which utilizes the `toSaveFile` helper 
method to format and write the updated reminder list to the `SaveFile` Document, ensuring the persistence of reminder 
data between user sessions.

![Sequence_addReminder.png](Images/Sequence_addReminder.png)


### List Reminder
The "view reminders" command triggers a sequence that iterates through the main reminder list. For each reminder, 
`printReminderDescription()` is called, displaying the description and deadline of each reminder. If the list is empty, 
the system outputs a message indicating no reminders are available. This functionality lets users view all saved 
reminders at a glance. 

When Parser detects the `list-remind` command, it calls `printReminderList()` followed by `printReminderCount()`.
`printSessionList()` first checks if reminderList is empty. If reminderList is empty, it prints a message saying so.
If reminderList is not empty, it will be iterated through.
For each Reminder in reminderList, `printReminderDescription()` is called, displaying the description and deadline of 
each reminder as String. The `Reminder` objects' index will be printed, followed by the description and deadline before
iterating to the next index. When all the Reminders have been printed, `Ui` calls `printSessionCount()` to display the total number of
Reminders in `reminderList`.

![Sequence_ListReminders.png](Images/Sequence_ListReminders.png)

### List Upcoming Reminders
The "list upcoming reminders" command (`list-remind`) invokes the 
`findUpcomingReminders(ArrayList<Reminder> mainReminderList)` helper method. This method iterates through 
`remainderList` similarly to `list-remind`, checking if each reminder’s deadline is within one week (168 hours) from the
current date/time. For reminders that match this condition, they are added to an `upcomingReminderList`. Finally, for 
each reminder in `upcomingReminderList`, `printReminderDescription()` is called, displaying only those reminders with due 
dates in the upcoming week. This function is called automatically at program initialisation to provide a summary 
reminder for users starting the program.

![Sequence_ListUpcomingReminders.png](Images/Sequence_ListUpcomingReminders.png)


### Delete Reminder
The delete command (`delete-remind <index>`) removes a reminder at the specified index from the main list. 
The validity of the passed `index` is checked, and an exception is thrown back to the parser to be handled if found to 
be out of bounds, improperly formatted, or non-numeric.

Before removal, the specified reminder is copied to a temporary instance, `sessionToDelete`, which holds the reminder's 
data for confirmation. Following deletion, the details of the deleted reminder are printed by invoking 
`printReminderDescription()` on `reminderToDelete`, confirming successful removal. The `sessionToDelete `instance is 
then discarded, ensuring efficient memory use. The `updateSaveFile` function is then called within the `Parser` class, 
using the local `toSaveFile` helper method to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for information 
permanence between user sessions.

![Sequence_DeleteReminder.png](Images/Sequence_DeleteReminder.png)


### Add Goals 

Goals allow users to set specific objectives within the application. Users can add goals using the
`add-goal <description> <date> <time>` command and view a list of all current goals via list-goal. 
Goals can also be deleted by their unique IDs using the `delete-goal <goal ID>` command. 
This feature provides users with a clear structure for setting, tracking, and managing their fitness objectives. 
Goals are stored separately from training sessions and are accessible as a distinct list. After both the addition 
(`add-goal`) and deletion (`delete-goal`) functions are executed, the `updateSaveFile` function is called within the 
`Parser` class, using local `toSaveFile` helper methods to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for 
information permanence between user sessions.

### Add Food Intake

Food intake tracking helps users monitor their daily calorie intake. Each entry records a 
food item's name, quantity, and calorie count. This data is used to calculate total calorie intake,
which can be viewed as a summary. The functionality supports daily nutritional monitoring, helping 
users align their diet with fitness goals.

When the user inputs the command to add a new food item (`add-food <food name> <calories>`), an instance of FoodEntry is
created, containing details like the food name, calorie count, and timestamp. This FoodEntry instance is then passed to 
the `addFood(FoodEntry food)` method in the FoodWaterIntake class. Here, the food item is added to the `foodList`, 
a list that stores all the user’s food entries. UI confirmation output is generated once the call returns to the 
`Parser` class. The `updateSaveFile` function is then called within the `Parser` class, using the local
`toSaveFile` helper method to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for information permanence between
user sessions.

### Delete Food Intake
When the user enters a command to delete a food item (`delete-food <index>`), the system calls the 
`deleteFood(int foodIndex)` method with the specified index in the `FoodWaterIntake` class. Inside this method, an index
validation checks if the provided index is within the range of `foodList`. If valid, `remove(int index)` is invoked to 
remove the specified `FoodEntry` from `foodList`. The removed item is temporarily stored in a `FoodEntry` instance named 
`removed`, allowing it to be printed with a confirmation message If the index is invalid, the system outputs an error 
message. The `updateSaveFile` function is then called within the `Parser` class, using the local
`toSaveFile` helper method to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for information permanence between
user sessions.

### Add Water Intake

Water intake tracking helps users monitor their daily hydration. Users can add entries with the 
amount of water consumed, view a list of past entries, and delete specific records if needed. 
This feature aids in maintaining a balanced hydration level, which is essential for overall health 
and fitness performance.

The command to add water intake (`add-water <amount in ml>`) creates a new instance of WaterEntry, encapsulating the 
amount of water consumed and the timestamp. This instance is then passed to `addWater(WaterEntry water)`, where it is 
appended to waterList, a collection of all water entries. This addition is stored in waterList for later retrieval or 
display. Like `addFood`, this method returns a UI confirmation to the user, then the `updateSaveFile` function is then 
called within the `Parser` class, using the local `toSaveFile` helper method to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for information permanence between
user sessions.

### Delete Water Intake
Upon parsing the command `delete water <index>`, `deleteWater(int waterIndex)` is invoked within the `FoodWaterIntake` 
class, which checks the validity of the specified index against `waterList`. If the index is valid, `remove(int index)` 
is used to delete the specified WaterEntry from waterList, storing it temporarily in a WaterEntry instance named 
`removed`. This instance data is then used to confirm deletion via a UI message to the user. If the index is invalid, 
a message is displayed to notify the user. The `updateSaveFile` function is then called within the `Parser` class, using the local
`toSaveFile` helper method to write a formatted string to the SaveFile Document - for information permanence between
user sessions.

### Points Calculation

The **points calculation feature** is a significant part of the `ExerciseStation` system. It allows for the calculation
of user-specific points based on their performance in various exercises (e.g., pull-ups, sit-ups). This process 
involves interaction between the `ExerciseStation` and the `Calculator` classes, ensuring that the correct points are
assigned based on predefined lookup tables found [here](https://www.dunmansec.moe.edu.sg/files/pe_napfa.pdf).

#### 1. Class Interaction Overview

Each `ExerciseStation` subclass (e.g., `PullUpStation`, `SitUpStation`) has its own implementation of the `getPoints()` 
method. The main responsibility of this method is to invoke the `calculatePoints()` function from the 
respective **calculator** class (e.g., `PullUpCalculator`, `SitUpCalculator`), which holds the points calculation logic.

#### 2.  Sequence of Events:
![Sequence_getPoints.png](Images/Sequence_getPoints.png)

1. **User Inputs Performance**: The user’s performance (e.g., number of pull-ups) is passed to the
   `setPerformance()` method in the exercise station.

2. **Invoke Points Calculation**: Once the performance is set, the `getPoints()` method is called. 
   This method interacts with the calculator class (e.g., `PullUpCalculator`) to compute the points.

3. **Calculator Logic**: The calculator class uses a lookup table, which maps the user's performance 
   to points based on their age and gender. The points are returned to the exercise station, where they are stored.

### Training Data Visualisation (Points/Performance)

This **visualisation feature** called from the `Ui` class enables users to generate various visualisations of training 
session data, providing insights into progress and performance. This feature, due to its size and complexity, is 
implemented in helper classes (expanded below) instead of directly within `Ui`.

The `GraphPerformance` and `GraphPoints` classes handle data visualisation for training sessions, each designed to offer 
targeted graphing capabilities:
   - `GraphPoints`: Displays points accumulated across training sessions.
   - `GraphPerformance`: Focuses on visualising performance metrics (reps or timings) for specific exercises.

These classes inherit from the abstract `GraphBase` class, which consolidates shared methods for both subclasses.
A class diagram is provided below to illustrate the structure and inheritance of the these classes:

![Class_GraphOverview.png](Images/Class_GraphOverview.png)

#### 1. `GraphPoints` Class

The `GraphPoints` class provides two main functions to visualise points across training sessions, as outlined below:

   1. `graphSessions(ArrayList<TrainingSession> sessionList)`
      - Purpose: Display the total points achieved in each training session.
      - Usage: Takes a list of `TrainingSession` objects and outputs a graph showing cumulative points per session.
      
   2. `graphExercisePoints(Exercise exercise, ArrayList<TrainingSession> sessionList)`
      - Purpose: Visualise points progression for a specified exercise over multiple sessions.
      - Usage: Takes an `Exercise` object and a list of `TrainingSession` objects, displaying a points graph focused on 
the specified exercise.

##### Workflow of the graph points functions

   1. **Header Generation**:
      - The header string is generated for each column in the visualisation.

   2. **Row Generation**:
      - Each row, representing a training session, is iteratively generated.
      - Rows are appended to the a `StringBuilder`, which accumulates the entire graph's content.

   3. **CLI Output**:
      - The accumulated graph string is printed to the CLI.

A sequence diagram is shown below to illustrate the workflow:

![Sequence_graphSessions.png](Images/Sequence_graphSessions.png)

> Note: The primary difference between `graphSessions` and `graphExercisePoints` lies in the 
> the calculation method called. (`getTotalPoints` for sessions, `getExercisePoints` for specific exercises).
   
#### 2. `GraphPerformance` Class

The `GraphPerformance` class is an abstract base for generating visual representations of exercise performance across 
multiple training sessions. Given the need for varied visualisation styles based on exercise type, `GraphPerformance` is 
extended by two specific subclasses:

   - `GraphPerformanceTime`: Handles time-based exercises. 
   - `GraphPerformanceRepsDistance`: Manages rep-based and distance-based exercises.

Each subclass customises the graph body content generation to reflect the nature of the exercise data.
The shared aspects, including headers and basic layout, are handled in `GraphPerformance` to avoid repetitive code.
The primary method of `GraphPerformance` is `graphExercisePerformance` which handles both time based and rep based 
visualisations for performance. Its workflow is described below. 

##### Workflow of `graphExercisePerformance` 

   1. **Generate X-Axis Headers**
      - Create a String for X-Axis headers, including session descriptions and dates.

   2. **Generate Graph Body Content**
      - Subclasses `GraphPerformanceTime` and `GraphPerformanceRepsDistance` generate their respective row content for 
time or reps data, represented by asterisks. This row content is compiled in a String.

   3. **Display Output to CLI** 
      - Compiles the X-Axis headers, and body content in a String to display a complete graph. This is directly output 
to the command line, allowing users to visualize exercise progress.       

![Sequence_graphExercisePerformance.png](Images/Sequence_graphExercisePerformance.png)

#### Static Design Rationale

> All methods within `GraphPoints and `GraphPerformance` are static as they work independently of instance-specific
> data. 

#### `GraphPerformanceRepsDistance` Class

This class is responsible for visualising reps or distance, over time. It generates a **bar** graph where the y-axis 
represents the units of performance (reps or distance), and each training session is represented by a column on the 
x-axis. Each row within a column contains asterisks (`*`), where each asterisks represents one unit of performance.
In addition, the total points for each session displayed at the top of the column. 

##### Workflow 
   1. **Building the String for a row**
      - For each level of performance (row), iterate through each training session.
      - If that session's performance is greater than or equal to the current level, an asterisk (`*`) is placed in that 
column.
      - If that session's performance is greater than the current level by 1 performance metric, append the points 
achieved for that exercise in that particular training session.
      
   2. **Repeat for all performance levels**
      - Iteratively place asterisks for each level of performance, starting from the maximum, 
until the minimum level is reached.

Below is a sequence diagram detailing the above workflow:

![Sequence_GraphPerformanceRepsDistance.png](Images/Sequence_GraphPerformanceRepsDistance.png)

#### `GraphPerformanceTime` Class
##### Purpose
The `GraphPerformanceTime` class is a specialized subclass of `GraphPerformance`, designed to handle the visual 
representation of time-based performance data for *Shuttle Run* and *Walk and Run* stations. This class formats 
and prints a scatter graph of normalized time data against sessions to the command line. Normalized data points
are represented with an asterisk (`*`).

##### Normalization Process
The class uses a normalization technique to represent the data points on a scale from 0 to 1, ensuring that the
graph maintains a consistent appearance regardless of the raw performance range. This scaling allows for a 
uniform distribution of data across the graph, enhancing readability.

**$ \text{Normalized Performance} = \frac{\text{Performance} - \text{Min Performance}} 
{\text{Max Performance} - \text{Min Performance}}$**

##### Implementation Details of graph body
1. **Generating Main Graph Content**:
   - The `buildMainContents` method is responsible for constructing the main body of the graph. It iterates through a
     range of normalized values, decrementing by 0.05 to create rows representing performance levels from 1.00 to 0.00.
   - For each row, the `processResultToPoint` method checks whether the normalized performance of each training session
     aligns with the current level. If it matches within a tolerance (e.g., 0.025), an asterisk (`*`) is placed on the 
     graph.

2. **Formatting Display Time**:
   - The `processDisplayTime` method formats the raw time data depending on the type of exercise. 
   -  (i) For *Shuttle Run*, the time is shown in seconds to one decimal place.
   - (ii) For *Walk and Run* exercises are displayed in `mm:ss` format, with leading zeros added for consistency.
   - If there are no time data found in a specfic session, `NIL` is displayed.

##### Edge Cases Handled
- **No Data Available**: If no valid performance time data exists, the graph will not display any asterisk (`*`) for 
  that session.
- **Consistent Performance**: When all performance values are the same, the class ensures that a line of points is 
  printed at the top of the graph to indicate uniformity.

Below is a sequence diagram detailing the above workflow:

## Product scope
### Target user profile

FitTrack is made for students who are training for NAPFA, who should not be distracted by a GUI interface.

### Value proposition

FitTrack provides a convenient way of recording and tracking their NAPFA performance. 
It automatically computes their scores and awards, saving them time and hassle. 
It is optimized to be simple, lightweight and minimalistic so that students do not have to exit their study environment.
