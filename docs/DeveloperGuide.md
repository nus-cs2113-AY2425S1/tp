   - Description:Represents the category name, set as a read-only attribute.

#### Class main Methods
1. **public Category(String name)**
   - **Parameters**:
     - **`name`**: The category name.
   - **Process**: Initializes the name attribute with the specified value.

2. **public String getName()**
   - **Returns**: The `name` of the Category object.
   - **Process**: Provides access to name attribute.

3. **public boolean equals(Object obj)**
   - **Parameters**:
     - **`obj`**: The object to compare for equality.
   - **Returns**: `true` if `obj` is a Category instance with the same name, `false` otherwise.
   - **Process**: Checks if `obj` is a Category instance and compares its name with the current `Category` object’s name.

   ![Category](./diagrams/category/category-class-diagram.png)
4. **public int hashCode()**
   - **Returns**: The hash code based on the name.
   - **Process**: Calculates the hash code for storing `Category` objects in hash-based collections.

5. **public String toString()**
   - **Returns**: The formatted description of the category
   - **Process**: Generates a string representation of the `Category` object, useful for logging and debugging.

### Transaction - Expense - Income
The `Transaction` class is an abstract class to provide the similar behavior for Income and Expense class. It serves as the foundational representation of a transaction.

The `Expense` class stores the data of an expense and gives string presentation function. It serves as the representation of an expense.

The `Income` class stores the data of an income and gives string presentation function. It serves as the representation of an income.

#### Class attributes
1. **description**: String
   - Description: Represents the transaction description.

2. **dateTimeString**: String
   - Description: Represents the date and time for the transaction. As we use Gsom library for parsing JSON data, we store this attribute as a String.

3. **amount**: Double
   - Description: Represents the amount of a transaction.

4. **category**: Category
   - Description: Private attribute for `Expense` class, to show the category of that expense.
   
#### Class main Methods

The other `ViewExpenseCommand` and `ViewIncomeCommand` has the similar logic.

#### Class responsibilities

1. **Filtering transaction list**: The command filter the transaction list and find the transaction that meets the criteria
3. **Return filtered string list**: The command return the filtered list of transactions in string format for displaying.

#### Class attributes
1. **transactions**: `TransactionList`
    - Description: Stores the current list of all transactions.

#### Class main methods

1. **execute()**
    - **Returns**: `List<String>`
    - **Process**: As the arguments are optional, the command do a step-by-step filter for each criteria if it found the corresponding arguments
        - Create a copy `ArrayList<Transaction> temp` from `transactions` for filtering
        - Check the availability of the start date
           - If available: `temp` = `temp` filtered by start date

        - Check the availability of the end date
           - If available: `temp` = `temp` filtered by end date

        - Check if the start date is after the end date
           - If yes: throw new exception (as the start date should be before the end date)

        - Return a list of stringified filtered-transactions

    ![execute](./diagrams/ViewHistoryDiagram/viewhistory-flow-diagram.png)
   
### Command Parser
The `Parser` class is responsible for interpreting user commands and extracting the associated arguments. It facilitates interaction between the user and the underlying command execution logic. There is only one Command Parser living through a session.

#### Class responsibilities
1. **Command registration**: Maintain a mapping of command words to their corresponding `Command` objects. This command object will maintain throughout the session and every execution will be called through it.

     - Find the first keyword in the list that appears in the argumentString
     - If found:
       - Attach the part before the keyword with the previously found keyword and put in to `arguments`.
       - Delete the keyword from the `keywords` list (to not be considered in the next call)
       - Pass the remaining `argumentString` after the keyword to the next recursive call
     - If not found (mean that the last keyword reached):
       - Attach the remaining part with the previously found keyword and put in to `arguments`.
