### Command
The `Command` class is an abstract class that provide a common behavior that other commands can share.

#### Class responsibilities
1. **Defining common structure**: It provides common fields that ensure consistency across all concrete command classes that extend Command.
2. **Defining common behavior**: It provides a template for commands by the abstract methods (e.g. `execute()`, etc.), the class enables developers to add new commands by simply extending the base class and implementing the specific behavior for each command.
3. **Defining some reusable methods**: It provides some common methods (e.g. `isArgumentsValid()`, `setArguments()`, `getArguments()`, etc.) across child classes.

#### Class attributes
1. **COMMAND_WORD**: `String`
    - Description: The keyword triggering the command. The inherit classes will override this static variable by their own values.
2. **COMMAND_GUIDE**: `String`
    - Description: Description of the command. The child classes will override this static variable by their own values.
3. **COMMAND_MANDATORY_KEYWORDS**: `String[]`
    - Description: Array storing mandatory argument keywords. The child classes will override this static variable by their own values.
4. **COMMAND_EXTRA_KEYWORDS**: `String[]`
    - Description: Array storing optional argument keywords. The child classes will override this static variable by their own values.
5. **arguments**: `Map<String, String>`
    - Description: A map storing argument strings along with its keyword.

#### Class main methods
1. **execute(): abstract void**
    - **Responsibility**: Act as a template for the child classes.

2. **isArgumentsValid(): boolean**
    - **Returns**: `true` if the `arguments` map contains all the mandatory keywords, `false` otherwise. Can be reused by the child classes.
      
### AddIncomeCommand
The `AddIncomeCommand` class inherits Command class, handles the logic for adding an income transaction to the `TransactionList` by parsing input arguments, creating a new `Income` instance, and updating the transaction list.

![AddIncomeCommand](./diagrams/addincomecommand/addincomecommand-class-diagram.png)

#### Class responsibilities

1. **transactions**: `TransactionList`
    - Description: Stores the current list of all transactions.

#### Class main methods

1. **execute()**
    - **Returns**: `List<String>`

     - Find the first keyword in the list that appears in the argumentString
     - If found:
       - Attach the part before the keyword with the previously found keyword and put in to `arguments`.
       - Delete the keyword from the `keywords` list (to not be considered in the next call)
       - Pass the remaining `argumentString` after the keyword to the next recursive call
     - If not found (mean that the last keyword reached):
       - Attach the remaining part with the previously found keyword and put in to `arguments`.
