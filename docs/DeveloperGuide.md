## Design & Implementation
### Architecture
> Sequence Diagram on initialisation of BookBob:
>![img.png](MainSequenceDiagram.png)
> The Object Diagram on initialisation of BookBob:
![img.png](MainObjectDiagram.png)

The _**Architecture Diagram**_ given above explains the high-level design of BookBob. 
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other. 
**Main** components of the architecture 
`Main` is in charge of the launch of BookBob and its shutdown.
![img.png](Main.png)
- At application launch, it initialises other components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other. 
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary. 

 ---

The bulk of the BookBob's work is done by the following components: 
- `CommandHandler`: The command executor.<br>
  ![img.png](CommandHandler.png)

 ---

- `FileHandler`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.<br>
  ![img.png](FileHandler.png)

 ---

The entities storing data are the following components: <br>
- `Records`: The list of patients. <br>
  ![img.png](Records.png)

 ---

- `AppointmentRecord`: The list of appointments. <br>
  ![img.png](AppointmentRecord.png)

 ---

- `Appointment` : Information of appointment. <br>
  ![img.png](Appointment.png)

 ---

- `Visit`: The visit of patients. <br>
  ![img.png](Visit.png)

 ---

- `Patient`: Personal information of patient. <br>
  ![img.png](Patient.png)

 ---

### 1. Managing Patient Visits and Records
### a. Adding New Visits for Existing Patients
The addVisit mechanism is handled by `CommandHandler`. It begins by scanning the patient records (`Records`) to locate 
the patient with the specified NRIC. Once the target patient is found, a new `Visit` object is created using the 
provided visit details. This new visit is then added to the patient's `ArrayList<Visit>`. Finally, the updated patient 
records are saved using `FileHandler` to ensure they can be retrieved later.

**Doctor enters the command:** `addVisit ic/S9870789B v/29-10-2024 10:00 d/Gastric m/Gaviscon, Paracetamol`

> The Sequence Diagram for the execution of addVisit command:
![img.png](AddVisitSequenceDiagram.png)

 ---

### b. Adding New Patient to the Patient Records
The "add" command mechanism for New Patients(first visit to clinic) is handled by `CommandHandler`. It begins by creating a new `Patient` object to store all related
information from terminal input. A new `Visit` object is compulsory to be created with the `Patient` object. This new 
visit is then added to the patient's `ArrayList<Visit>`. Finally, the new patient will be stored into the patient 
records (`Records`) which will be saved using `FileHandler` to ensure they can be retrieved later.

**Doctor enters the command:** `add n/Patricia Chan ic/S9870789B p/98097890 d/Cough m/Antibiotics ha/Bukit Batok East Avenue 3 
dob/01111998 v/21-10-2024 18:00 al/Peanuts s/Female mh/Hypertension`

> The Object Diagram before the execution of "add" command:
![img.png](ObjectDiagramBeforeAddPatient.png)

> The Object Diagram after the execution of "add" command:
![img.png](ObjectDiagramAfterAddPatient.png)

> The Sequence Diagram(s) for the execution of "add" command:

• There are two parts to the sequence diagrams; Part(1) shows the process for System Initialization and Input Processing, and Part(2)
shows the Patient Creation and Data Storage processes. 

<u>Part(1) System Initialization and Input Processing</u> :
![img.png](NewPatientSequenceDiagram_1.png)
• This sequence diagram illustrates the initial phase of adding a new patient to the BookBob.
When the Doctor inputs the "add" command with patient details, the system workflow begins :
1. Main receives doctor's "add" command and routes it through Parser to CommandHandler.
2. CommandHandler performs validation checks and extracts mandatory fields (name, NRIC, visit date)
3. System either returns an error message if validation fails, or proceeds to patient creation.

<u>Part (2) Patient Creation and Data Storage</u> :
![img.png](NewPatientSequenceDiagram_2.png)
This sequence diagram shows the process of creating and storing a new patient's record after successful validation. The system workflow :
1. Extracts all remaining patient information (phone number, home address, DOB, allergies, medical histories).
2. Constructing a new Visit object with the provided data.
3. Creating a new Patient object (with core information i.e. name, NRIC).
4. Setting additional patient attributes (phone number, home address, DOB, allergies, medical histories). 
5. Adds patient to Records and auto-saves the data.

 ---

### c. Appointment Feature

The appointment mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHandler`. It creates an appointment slot via the `Appointment` 
class and records it within the `AppointmentRecord` class. The appointment records will then be saved into 
`FileHandler`.

- `CommandHandler.appointment(String input, AppointmentRecord appointmentRecord)` - check the input to check if valid
- `FileHandler.initFile(AppointmentRecord appointmentRecord)` - loads any saved appointment records
- `appointmentRecord.checkAvailability(LocalDate date, LocalTime time)` - check for availability at given time and date
- `AppointmentRecord.addAppointment(Appointment appointment)` - add appointment to the appointment record
- `Appointment(String name, String nric, String date, String time)` - creates appointment with the given name, nric,
- date and time
- `FileHandler.autosave(AppointmentRecord appointmentRecord)` - save the appointment records

**Doctor enters the command:** `appointment n/Patricia Chan ic/S9870789B date/06-11-2024 time/14:30`

## Appendix A: Product Scope
### Target User Profile
Dr Bob is a General Practitioner running his own private clinic. He manages everything independently, attending to
significant number of patients with diverse health concerns each day. The demanding workload and long hours often leave him exhausted
and sleep-deprived. On his work desk, he relies on a personal desktop computer for his work. Dr Bob is a fast typer, prefers typing to mouse interactions, and is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

### Value Proposition
BookBob assists Dr Bob in storing and retrieving his patients' information, including their name, NRIC, sex, date of
birth, phone number, home address, allergies, medical history and visit records with details like diagnoses and
prescribed medications. Additionally, BookBob helps Dr Bob stay organised by tracking his daily appointments and
providing reminders of upcoming appointments at the start of each day. BookBob is a CLI-Optimised program, allowing quicker and easier managing of patients records compared to a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
