### Command Component

#### Overview

To interact with BuffBuddy, the user's input commands are parsed into discrete `Command` objects that have the sole responsibility of accomplishing that task.

As BuffBuddy contains many commands and thus many types of `Command` subclasses, the following diagram presents a simplified representation of the various `Command` classes:

![Summary of Command classes](images/commandSummary.png)

Each abstract subclass of `Command` represents a generalization of the various commands available to BuffBuddy. In the following sections, each abstract class and their respective purposes will be elaborated on.

#### Programme Commands

`ProgrammeCommand` is an abstract class for all `Command` classes that interact with `ProgrammeList` and its encapsulated data.
The following diagram documents all `ProgrammeCommand` subclasses.

![Summary of Programme classes](images/programmeCommandSummary.png)

`EditProgrammeCommand` classes are a subset of `ProgrammeCommand` classes that focus specifically on editing the internal `ProgrammeList` data. As this data is concerned only with `ProgrammeList`, `EditCommand#execute()` has been narrowed through method overloading to only take in `ProgrammeList` as a parameter.

![Summary of Edit classes](images/editCommandSummary.png)

#### Meal Commands

`MealCommand` is an abstract class for all `Command` classes that interact with meal-related data within the application. These commands allow users to log, edit, and manage their meal entries, ensuring that their dietary information is accurately tracked and updated. The following diagram documents all `MealCommand` subclasses.

![Summary of Meal classes](images/mealCommandSummary.png)

#### Water Commands

`WaterCommand` is an abstract class for all `Command` classes that interact with water-related data within the application. These commands allow users to log, edit, and manage their water intake entries, ensuring that their hydration information is accurately tracked and updated. The following diagram documents all `WaterCommand` subclasses.

![Summary of Water classes](images/waterCommandSummary.png)

#### History Commands

`HistoryCommand` is an abstract class for all `Command` classes that interact with `History` data within the application. These involve viewing weekly summaries, viewing their recorded data and getting their personal bests for each exercise. The following diagram documents all `HistoryCommand` subclasses.

![Summary of History classes](images/historyCommandSummary.png)

## Implementation

### Create Programme

#### Overview

#### Overview
The **Create Programme** feature allows users to create a new workout programme. Users can either create a simple programme
with just a name or design a multi-day schedule containing various exercises with details such as sets, reps, weight, and calories. 
This feature enables users to personalize their workout plans according to their fitness goals.

These operations include:
- Parsing the programme name and optional day/exercise details.
- Creating and organizing Day and Exercise objects within the programme.
- Adding the completed programme to ProgrammeList.

#### Example Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario for 'create programme' and how the create programme command functions at each step.

**Step 1**: The user executes the command `programme create Starter /d 1 /e Push-Ups /e Squats` to create a new programme named "Starter" with one day containing two exercises: "Push-Ups" and "Squats".

**Step 2**: After parsing this input, a `CreateProgrammeCommand` is created.

**Step 3**: The command then calls `ProgrammeCommandFactory#prepareCreateCommand()` to parse the details of the programme.

**Step 4**: Inside `prepareCreateCommand`, the programme name and day details are parsed. For each day specified:
- `ProgrammeCommandFactory#parseDay()` is called to create a new `Day` object.
- For each exercise in the day, `ProgrammeCommandFactory#parseExercise()` is called to create an `Exercise` object with the specified details.
- Each created `Exercise` is added to the `Day` object.

**Step 5**: The `CreateProgrammeCommand` then calls `ProgrammeList#insertProgramme()` with the parsed programme name and list of days to add the new programme to `ProgrammeList`.

**Step 6**: The created `Programme` object is returned to `CreateProgrammeCommand`.

**Step 7**: The `CreateProgrammeCommand` formats a message indicating successful creation of the programme.

**Step 8**: The formatted message is included in a `CommandResult`, which is returned to the user interface.

**Step 9**: The user interface displays the result message to the user, confirming the successful creation of the programme.

#### Sequence Diagram

![Sequence Diagram for createProgramme feature](./images/createProgramme.png)


_Note_: Happy path is assumed in the sequences diagram. Error handling has been simplified to keep the diagram brief.
Generally, if a conditional check fails (i.e. if the Programme Name is missing), a ProgrammeException will be thrown and 
interrupt the command execution. BuffBuddy will print the appropriate error message based on the Exception and then wait for the next command.

### Edit Programme

#### Overview

The **Edit Programme** feature allows for in-depth management of programme structures, supporting operations to add, remove, and update days and exercises within each programme.

To perform an edit to any aspect of this data, the EditCommand will traverse the ProgrammeList and its nested data structures until it reaches the necessary depth to perform its edit operation.

These operations include:

- Adding or removing Days to the Programme
- Adding or removing Exercises to Days in the Programme
- Updating the details of Exercises in Days in the Programme

##### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario for 'delete exercise' and how the edit programme functions at each step.

Step 1. The user creates a programme with a given number of Days with their respective Exercises. ProgrammeList will contain a reference to this programme after its creation.

Step 2. The user executes `programme edit /p 1 /d 1 /xe 1` to delete the first exercise in the first day of the first programme.

Step 3. After parsing this input, a `DeleteExerciseCommand` (inheriting from the generic `EditProgrammeCommand`) is created and executed.

Step 4. The command first retrieves the chosen Programme with `ProgrammeList#getProgramme()`.

Step 5. The command then retrieves the chosen Day with `Programme#getDay()`.

Step 6. With the Day object, it performs the `Day#deleteExercise()` with the given exercise ID

Step 7. The deleted Exercise object is then returned to the `DeleteExerciseCommand` to display as part of the returned `CommandResult`.

#### Sequence Diagram

The overall design that enables this functionality is described generically by the following sequence diagram.

![Edit Command generic sequence](images/editCommand.png)

The `Model` class in the above diagram is a generalization of the various data models that are being interacted with
to perform each specific edit command. For each edit command, the following sequence diagrams
further break down how this interaction works.

In each diagram, error handling has been simplified to keep the diagram brief.
Generally, if a conditional check fails (i.e. if the selected `Programme` does not exist), a `ProgrammeException` will be thrown and interrupt the command execution. `BuffBuddy` will print the appropriate error message based on the Exception and then wait for the next command.

<!-- @@author Atulteja -->

### Add Meal

#### Overview

The **Add Meal** feature manages the functionality related to adding meals to a daily record. It interacts with various components such as `History`, `DailyRecord`, and `MealList` to ensure meals are added correctly.

The **Add Meal** command navigates through the following hierarchy:

- **History** â†’ **DailyRecord** â†’ **MealList**
- If a `DailyRecord` does not exist for a given date, it is created before adding the meal.
- Similarly, a new `MealList` object is created and added to the `DailyRecord` if it doesn't already exist. The meal is then added to the `MealList` object.

These operations include:

- Adding meals to a `MealList` in the `DailyRecord` of a particular date in the `History`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a meal and how the add meal command functions at each step.

#### Example Usage

**Step 1**: The user starts by adding a meal using the command:

meal add /n [mealName] /c [calories]

- The command is parsed and translated into an `AddMealCommand` object, which contains the meal object that is created as a wrapper for the name and calories.

**Step 2**: The command retrieves the `DailyRecord` for the specified date from the `History` using `getRecordByDate()`. If no record exists, a new one is created.

**Step 3**: The `AddMealCommand` adds the meal to the `MealList` of the `DailyRecord`. The `MealList` is then updated with the new list.

**Step 4**: The newly added `Meal` object is displayed as part of the `CommandResult`.

The overall design that enables this functionality is described generically by the following sequence diagram.

#### Sequence Diagram for "Add Meal" Command

### Add Water

The **Add Water** feature manages the functionality related to adding water to a daily record. It interacts with various components such as `History`, `DailyRecord`, and `Water` to ensure water are added correctly.

The Add Water command navigates through the following hierarchy:
- **History** â†’ **DailyRecord** â†’ **Water**
- If a `DailyRecord` does not exist for a given date, it is created before adding the water.

These operations include:
- Adding a water log to `Water` in the `DailyRecord` of a particular date in `History`.
- 
Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a water log and how to add water command functions at each step. 

#### Example Usage

**Step 1**: The user starts by adding a water log using the command:

water add /v WATER_VOLUME [/t Date] 

- The command is parsed and translated into an `AddWaterCommand` object. Water contains an arrayList of floats, representing ml of water.

**Step 2**: The command retrieves the `DailyRecord` for the specified date from the `History` using `getRecordByDate()`. If no record exists, a new one is created.

**Step 3**: The `AddWaterCommand` adds the water log to the `Water` of the `DailyRecord`. The `Water` is then updated with the new water log.

**Step 4**: The newly added water log object is displayed as part of the `CommandResult`.

The overall design that enables this functionality is described generically by the following sequence diagram.

### WeeklySummary Feature

The Weekly Summary feature allows users to view a summary of their workouts for the current week. This functionality is achieved through a combination of several interconnected components, including `WeeklySummaryCommand`, `Parser`, `HistoryCommandFactory`, and `History`. Users can access this feature through the `history wk` command in the UI. The implementation follows a command pattern, combined with the factory pattern for command creation.

### Overview

The following components are crucial to the Weekly Summary feature:

1. **Parser Component**  
   The `Parser` interprets the initial command and directs the flow as follows:

   - **`Parser#parse(String)`**: Accepts the raw input string, splits it into the main command and arguments.
   - **`CommandFactory`**: Generates the appropriate command object based on the parsed input.
   - **`HistoryCommandFactory`**: Handles the creation of history-related commands, including `WeeklySummaryCommand`.

2. **WeeklySummaryCommand Component**  
   The `WeeklySummaryCommand` implements the `Command` interface and performs the following:

   - Extends the abstract `Command` class.
   - Uses the command word `"wk"`.
   - Executes by retrieving the weekly summary from the `History` object.
   - Returns a `CommandResult` that contains the formatted summary for display.

3. **History Component**  
   The `History` class manages workout data and provides:

   - **`getWeeklyWorkoutSummary()`**: Retrieves and formats the workout data for the current week.

### Example Usage

The following example illustrates the usage scenario and behavior of the Weekly Summary feature:

1. **Step 1**: The user enters the `"history wk"` command in the UI. The UI reads this command and passes it to the `Parser`.
2. **Step 2**: The `Parser` breaks down the command `"history wk"` into:
   - Main command: `"history"`
   - Subcommand: `"wk"`
3. **Step 3**: The `Parser` uses `CommandFactory`, which recognizes this as a history command and delegates to `HistoryCommandFactory`.
4. **Step 4**: `HistoryCommandFactory` identifies `"wk"` as the `WeeklySummaryCommand` trigger and creates a new `WeeklySummaryCommand` instance.
5. **Step 5**: The `WeeklySummaryCommand` is passed back through the chain to the UI, which then calls its `execute` method.
6. **Step 6**: During execution:
   - `WeeklySummaryCommand` calls `History`'s `getWeeklyWorkoutSummary()`.
   - The summary is formatted and wrapped in a `CommandResult`.
   - The UI displays the result to the user.

### Log Programme Feature

The Log Programme feature allows users to log a specific day of a workout programme into the history on a specified date. This feature is implemented using components like `LogProgrammeCommand`, `Parser`, `ProgrammeCommandFactory`, and `History`. Users can activate this feature by entering the `prog log` command in the UI. The implementation follows the command pattern, alongside a factory pattern for creating commands.

### Overview

The following component is crucial to the Log Programme feature:

1. **LogProgrammeCommand Component**  
   The `LogProgrammeCommand` is responsible for logging a workout day from a programme into the history and provides:

    - Extends the abstract `Command` class.
    - Uses the command word `"log"`.
    - Executes by retrieving the specified day from the `ProgrammeList` and logging it to the `History`.
    - Returns a `CommandResult` containing a success message or relevant feedback.

### Example Usage

The following example illustrates the usage scenario and behavior of the Log Programme feature:

1. **Step 1**: The user enters the `prog log /p [PROG_INDEX] /d [DAY_INDEX] /t [DATE]` command in the UI. The UI reads this command and passes it to the `Parser`.
2. **Step 2**: The `Parser` breaks down the command `prog log` into:
    - Main command: `prog`
    - Subcommand: `log`
3. **Step 3**: The `Parser` uses `CommandFactory`, which recognizes this as a programme command and delegates to `ProgrammeCommandFactory`.
4. **Step 4**: `ProgrammeCommandFactory` identifies `log` as the `LogProgrammeCommand` trigger and creates a new `LogProgrammeCommand` instance with the specified parameters.
5. **Step 5**: The `LogProgrammeCommand` is passed back through the chain to the UI, which then calls its `execute` method.
6. **Step 6**: During execution:
    - `LogProgrammeCommand` retrieves the programme and day specified by the user from `ProgrammeList`.
    - It then logs the day to the `History` object using `History`'s `getRecordByDate()` and `logRecord()` methods.
    - The result is formatted in a `CommandResult`.
    - The UI displays the result to the user.

### Save/Load Feature

The save/load mechanism is handled by three main components: `Storage`, `FileManager`, and `DateSerializer`. `FileManager` manages file interactions, including reading from and writing to JSON data files, while `Storage` handles the conversion between JSON objects and `ProgrammeList`/`History` objects. The `DateSerializer` is used for converting `LocalDate` to/from JSON format.

### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the save/load mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. A `Storage` object is initialized by `BuffyBuddy`, and it attempts to load data from
the file using `FileManager`. If no data file exists, `Storage` initializes an empty `ProgrammeList` and `History`.

**Step 2.** The user interacts with the application by adding programmes or logging workout activities and meals, modifying both the
`ProgrammeList` and `History`. After each command is carried out and when the user chooses to exit the application, `Storage#saveData()` is called.

**Step 3.** At this point, `Storage` converts the current `ProgrammeList` and `History` into JSON format using the `createJSON()` method and passes
the `JsonObject` to `FileManager#save()`.

**Step 4.** The `FileManager` saves the updated `JsonObject` to the data file, ensuring that the user's changes are preserved for the
next command or session. If necessary, `FileManager#createDirIfNotExist()` and `FileManager#createFileIfNotExist()` ensure that the correct directories
and files are in place before saving.

**Step 5.** The next time the user launches the application, `Storage#loadProgrammeList()` and `Storage#loadHistory()` are called, which
load the data from the file via `FileManager#load()`. The loaded data is then converted from JSON back into `ProgrammeList` and `History`
objects, restoring the user's previous session.

The following sequence diagram shows how a load operation for ProgrammeList goes through the Storage component:
