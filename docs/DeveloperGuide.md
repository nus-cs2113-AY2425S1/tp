## Design & Implementation

### Architecture
A high-level overview of the system is shown in the **Architecture Diagram** below.  
![Architecture.drawio.png](Images%28DG%29%2FArchitecture.drawio.png)

### Main Components
- `PlanPal`: Main entry of the program, initialises and connects to the Ui
- `Ui`: In charge of printing messages
- `Parser`: Determines the command to execute
- `Modes`: Determines the group of functionalities that the user wants to use.
- `FileManager`: Read and write data from hard disk

### Program Flow
The sequence diagram below describes how the components interacts with one another when the user issues a command.

For simplicity, the 3 different modes will be classified as `:Mode`.

## Ui

<u>Overview</u>  
The `Ui` component handles operations that displays messages for the user to read as an instruction.  
Additionally, it is also used to capture user inputs in certain functions.

<u>Methods</u>  
The `Ui` component has the following key methods:

| Method                | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| printWelcomeMessage   | Prints the welcome message                                           |
| printAvailableModes   | Print all modes that are currently available in PlanPal              |
| printByeMessage       | Prints the good bye message                                          |
| printCreateStorage    | Prints the path to the storage that is created                       |
| getSetCategory        | Capture user input when using the category function in certain modes |
| printCat              | Prints the categories available in certain modes                     |
| printCategoryNotFound | Prints when category is not found                                    |
| print                 | Custom print function that accepts multiple strings                  |

<u>Design Considerations</u>  
This component was created as functionalities such as printing will be used in most of the classes in the PlanPal Application.  
Consolidating all the print methods that are repeated reduces repetition in code and makes it easier to update when necessary.

---

## Parser
<u>Overview</u>  
This component handles the logic behind the application. The parser component consists of the parent `Parser` Class and 3 children that inherits the `Parser` Class. These 3 children are used when the respective modes are in play.  

<u>Class Diagram for Parser Component</u>

![ParserClassDiagram.drawio.png](Images%28DG%29%2FParserClassDiagram.drawio.png)

<u>Design Considerations</u>  
The Parser class follows this structure as there are common commands between the different modes. Using inheritance prevents the repetition of code. Additionally, different parsers were created since different modes require different functionalities.

---

## Mode: Contact Manager
The class diagram below represents the contact book system

<u>Class Diagram for Contact Manager</u>  

![ContactClassDiagram.drawio.png](Images%28DG%29/ContactClassDiagram.drawio.png)

**General Classes**
- The `PlanPal` class is the main entry point of the system, containing a `main(String[])` method to launch the application.

- The `Parser` class is a class with methods to load and process commands from a file.
- The `BackUpManager` class manages data backups, including backing up, restoring, and creating directories for backup files.
- The `UI` class is responsible for displaying messages and menus to the user.
- The `ListFunctions` interface defines methods for list operations like adding, deleting, and finding items.
- The `FileManager` class handles saving and loading data to and from storage
- The `Storable` interface defines methods for managing storage paths and command descriptions.
- The `Editable` interface defines methods for editing command descriptions.

**Contact Classes**
- The `Contact` class represents a contact with attributes like name, phone, email, command description, and categories. It implements the Editable and Storable interfaces for editing and storage functionalities.

<u>Components Breakdown:</u>
- For simplicity, the `Ui` component has been taken out
- `ContactParser` class is the `Parser` component
- `ContactManager` class is the `Mode` component

<u>Explanation:</u> 
- Before this command is executed, the user will have to choose their mode.
- When modeInput is 1, representing contact manager, the user is then asked for a command in this mode.
- When command "add /name: john" is sent, the processCommand function is executed.
- Since the command is "add", addContact function is executed using the description "/name: john". 
- This creates a new contact and is then added to the list of contacts
- Finally, contact file is saved in the savedContacts FileManager.

### Delete Command
