## Overview

WheresMyMoney is an expense tracking application with additional features such as support for recurring expenses, spending limit alerts and spending visualisation.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add ability to edit expenses
    * What it does: This feature introduces the ability to edit the price, description, category and date added for an added expense
    * Justification: This is to allow the user to rectify a mistake rather than having to delete a particular expense and re-adding the correct expense. This is part of the basic CRUD functionality

* **New Feature**: Add help command for user
    * What it does: List down all commands, their parameters and their usage
    * Justification: This is to allow the user to find out what all the commands are and how to use them

* **New Feature**: Add support for recurring expenses
    * What it does: This feature allows the user to create, read, update and delete recurring expenses
    * Justficiation: Instead of having to always add the same expense that occur regularly with the same price, description and category, the user can just tell the programme to automate this process.
    * Highlights: The user can choose to have this expense added at fixed intervals (i.e Monthly, Weekly, Daily)
