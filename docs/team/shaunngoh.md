## Project: JavaNinja

JavaNinja is a desktop learning tool application designed for teaching programming concepts. Users interact with the tool via a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

Below are my key contributions to the project:

Here is also a link to the code I have contributed:

### Main Classes and Structure

- **Primary Class Structure and Relationships**:
    - **Primary Class Structure and Relationships**:
    - Created foundational classes: `Parser`, `Cli`, `JavaNinja`, `QuizGenerator`, `QuizManager`, `TopicManager`, `Topic`, `Question`, and `Quiz`.
    - Each class was designed to adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, ensuring that each class has a well-defined purpose and focuses on a single aspect of the applicationâ€™s functionality. This makes the codebase modular, maintainable, and extensible for future features.
    - Designed an object-oriented structure where each quiz session takes in a topic containing various question types, supporting modularity and extensibility.
    - Eventually allows for different types of generated quizzes, such as quizzes of multiple topics, timed quizzes, or untimed quizzes.

### New Features Implemented

- **CLI and Parser Functionality**:
    - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
        - **Enhanced User Interactions**: Implemented detailed, user-friendly messaging within CLI to guide users through commands and inputs.
        - **Dynamic Command Handling**: Developed CLI functionality to respond dynamically to user inputs, providing options and prompts based on the current context.
    - **Parser**:
        - **Flexible Command Parsing**: Implemented flexible parsing that supports multiple command formats (e.g., `select /d timed /t TOPIC | random`). The parser adapts to various user inputs and interprets both simple and complex commands.
        - **Robust Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection and handling within the parser to provide specific feedback on command issues and guide users toward correct usage.


- **Randomized Topic Selection in a Quiz Session**:
    - **Description**: Enabled users to take a quiz that randomly selects questions from multiple topics. Users can specify the number of topics and questions for a varied session.
    - **Justification**: Diversifies the learning experience by reinforcing concepts across subjects in one quiz session.

- **MCQ and Question Type Selection**:
    - **Description**: Added multiple question types, including Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ) and `Fill in the Blank (FITB)`, with options for timed and untimed sessions.
    - **Justification**: Provides different formats and timed options, adding challenge and flexibility to the quizzes.

- **Codebase Structure Improvements**:
    - **Description**: Redesigned and improved the code structure to follow object-oriented principles, enhancing modularity and cohesion.
    - **Justification**: Simplifies future development, enabling new features with minimal refactoring.

### Contributions to the User Guide

- **Enhanced Documentation for Randomized Topics**:
    - Explained usage of the randomized topic selection feature and provided clear example outputs.

- **Consistent Formatting**:
    - Edited the guide to ensure that example commands, outputs, and descriptions were clear and consistent.

- **Sections Contributed**:
    - Added detailed instructions for commands such as:
        - `select` for choosing topics or taking random quizzes
        - `view` and `review` for scores and history
        - `exit` and `quit` for ending sessions

---

### JUnit Tests

- **Extensive Test Coverage**:
    - Developed comprehensive JUnit tests for key components: `QuizGenerator`, `Parser`, `QuizManager`, `JavaNinja` and `TopicManager`.
    - **Justification**: Tests covered typical and edge cases, ensuring robustness and reliability.
    - **Approach**: Focused on high code coverage by testing individual methods and workflows, designing tests to catch bugs in both existing and new features.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide

- **Documentation and Formatting**:
    - Documented the `QuizGenerator`, `QuizManager`, `Parser`, `JavaNinja` and `TopicManager` classes with explanations of their structure and functions.
    - Reformatted the Developer Guide for readability, making it accessible for new developers.

- **Diagrams Created**:
    - **Class Diagrams**:
        - Created diagrams for `QuizGenerator`, `QuizManager`, `Parser`, `JavaNinja` and `TopicManager`, illustrating their structures and relationships.
    - **Sequence Diagrams**:
        - Developed sequence diagrams for each of the classes stated above and it's complex flows, such as quiz selection and random topic generation, to demonstrate internal interactions.

---

### Project Management and Team Contributions

- **Feature and Code Review**:
    - Conducted detailed code reviews, ensuring consistency, optimization, and adherence to coding standards.
    - Resolved Checkstyle issues across the codebase for uniform formatting and readability.

- **Collaborative Development**:
    - Actively engaged in team discussions, sharing insights on troubleshooting, debugging, and strategising new features.
