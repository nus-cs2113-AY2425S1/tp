### Feature Implemented
Here is the list of features implemented: 
1. Display Help Feature 
* What it does: Displays the full list of features available in the Budget Buddy application, along with the 
appropriate input format for each feature. 
* Justification: To provide a guide for new users to the application, improving the user experience for a new user.

2. Search Expense Feature
* What it does: Filters the expense entries in the app based on a given keyword provided by the user. 
* Justification: This feature improves the product because users are now able to easily filter their potentially
long list of expenses and search for specific expense entries. 

3. Breakdown Expenses Feature
* What it does: Provides insights into a user's expenditure by breaking down the user's total expense into the 
various categories. The feature then displays the total amount spent per category, as well as the percentage of
total expense spent per category. 
* Justification: To allow users to gain greater understanding of how they are spending their money and plan their
finances accordingly. 

4. Display Savings Feature
* What it does: Displays the total savings of the user based on the income and expense entries input by the user. The 
user can choose to view total savings or a monthly breakdown of their savings.
* Justification: This feature improves the product because users can keep track of their savings goals, and adjust
their expenses and incomes if necessary.
