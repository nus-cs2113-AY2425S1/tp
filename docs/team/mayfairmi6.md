## Project: SpendSwift

SpendSwift is a user-friendly budgeting tool crafted for budget-conscious individuals. With intuitive text commands, users can easily track expenses and manage their finances without the complexity of traditional budgeting tools. SpendSwift also supports budgeting on the go, making it ideal for travelers who need to track expenses in various currencies. The tool automatically adjusts for currency differences based on the latest exchange rates, sourced from our provider [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

### Contributions to the Project

- **Implemented Budget class** to help users set their budget limits, enter their home currency, and reset their budget cycle when needed.

- **BudgetManager**: Functionality to set budget limits in the BudgetManager class. Also, in the CurrencyConverter version (stacked in unused code correctly), this also tags the budget limit to the user’s home currency so expenses when declared in another currency can be checked in relative to this.

- **CurrencyConverter** (unable to merge due to some merge conflicts at the end and time spent in configuring API access/edit configuration files to make it run on all O.S as it was failing I/O redirection tests for macOS/ubuntu recently): convert expenses declared in a different currency and convert it to their home currency to help users track their expenses/budgets.

- **InputParser**: Adapt to accept both original currency of expense and home currency (enhancement which could not be implemented due to same reasons). For the one implemented, applied assertion checks so that the budget limit gets capped to 1 quadrillion if the user enters more than 1 quadrillion.

- **ExpenseManager**
  - **ViewExpensesByCategory**: To display all expenses grouped by their respective categories

- **Format**
  - In the CurrencyCode iteration (unused code), update this class to format the currency inputs in the appropriate format.

For the currency converter iteration only:
  - Updated the configuration files to make it run in different O.S

#### Contributions to the UG:

Updated to UG to inform the user of the limit the setBudget command can handle - which is 1 quadrillion, aimed at limiting inconveniences to users dealing with low value currencies such as Korean Won and Indonesian Rupiah.

#### Contributions to the DG:

Added non-functional requirements

For V1.0: added class diagram for previous version of expense tracker (now in unused diagrams)

Class diagram for duke class (now renamed to Spendswift)

Class diagrams for expense class, budget class, and category classes

Pull request: #85 (.puml codes)

#### Sequence Diagram Contributions for BudgetManager Methods:

- Developed sequence diagrams to illustrate the workflow of key methods in the BudgetManager class, capturing their interactions and functionality.
- Adapted to changes by removing diagrams for deprecated methods and merging some diagrams to streamline documentation.
- While some contributions may have become redundant due to last-minute adjustments, the initial sequence diagrams provided a clear structure and aided in aligning team members’ understanding of BudgetManager's functionality.
- These sequence diagrams can be accessed from pull request #131

#### Contributions to Team-Based Tasks:

- **Issue Tracker Management**: Actively maintained the issue tracker by regularly updating planned tasks, monitoring progress, and closing issues upon completion.
- **Code Enhancements and Adjustments**: Made necessary edits and improvements to shared project code whenever discrepancies or optimization opportunities were identified.
- **Clear Communication and Collaboration**: Facilitated clarity among team members on overlapping tasks by promptly addressing questions, sharing regular progress updates, and providing timely commits on GitHub to keep everyone informed on my current project standing.
- **Incorporating third-party libraries/API to implement related enhancements**: Requested permission for and attempted to integrate a functionality dealing with currency conversion of amount values entered in the application to deal with situations where budget limit and expenses are declared in different currencies. Also used gson library to parse the JSON file obtained from the API to 3-character string codes and double values to be processed by the convert method and rest of the classes in the project.
- **Testing**: Wrote Junit tests for classes BudgetManager, Format, and TrackerData, two of which were not written by me. Also added tests for the bug fix in which set Budget was not accepting values more than a certain value later.

#### Contributions Beyond the Project Team:

- **Bug Reporting in SLF4 Project**: Reported bugs and provided feedback on documentation aspects in the SLF4 project, highlighting issues like command readability in the user guide and limited usability of specific features
- **Peer Review Support**: Offered early feedback and clarifications for the IP peer review through email, facilitating a clearer understanding of the assigned peer’s project and supporting a more constructive review process (Product AngelBot)
- **Reviewed DG of another team**: Provided thorough feedback on the developer guide for BudgetBuddy, developed by CS2113-W10-1
