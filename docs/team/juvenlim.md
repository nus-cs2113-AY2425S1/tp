## Overview

Finance Buddy is a software that allows university students to log their daily expenditures to help manage their
budgets. Users can add, delete and edit expenditure logs into the app as well as list out all their logged
transactions. Users are also able to set a monthly budget for themselves in the app, and the app will notify them if
they have exceeded, or are close to exceeding, their budget.
