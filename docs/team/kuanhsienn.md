## Overview
EventManagerCLI is a desktop CLI application meant for managing small-scale events organised by one person. It is written in Java, and has around 8kLoC.
The app is optimised for quick, command-based interactions, ideal for users who prefer or need a text-based interface for efficient event management.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New feature**: Added the feature to add events.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add events by specifying details such as event name, datetime, venue.
    * Justification: This feature is a core functionality of the application, enabling users to keep track of planned events and manage their schedules effectively.
    * Highlights: The add event functionality includes validation of input formats (such as date and time) and prevents duplicate event entries. 

* **New feature**: Added the feature to remove events.
    * What it does: Enables users to delete events they no longer need, helping them keep the event list relevant and up-to-date.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for maintaining an organised event list. Users can remove events that are canceled or no longer relevant, which helps in decluttering their schedule.
    * Highlights:  This feature also checks for invalid entries or non-existent events, providing error messages to guide users, thus enhancing usability and robustness.

* **New feature**: Added the feature to save/load EventManager details to/from hard disk
    * What it does: Enables users to save event details (such as event list, participants, and items) to a file on the hard disk and load it back when the application is restarted. This ensures data persistence between sessions.
    * Justification: Persistent storage is a crucial feature for any event management tool, as it allows users to retrieve previously entered data and continue their work seamlessly.
    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

  * Highlights: The storage feature supports loading from a single CSV file, handling all event-related data in one file. 
  It includes validation checks to ensure data integrity, and if any data entry is corrupted or unreadable, a warning is logged without crashing the application.
  At the same time, it is able to save a wider range of characters due to adoption of UTF-8 encoding.

* **New feature**: Added feature to edit participant's info
    * What it does: Allows the user to update the information of participants associated with any event.
    * Justification:  Contact information can frequently change or there may be typos in the initial adding; this feature allows users to keep participant details current without needing to re-enter or delete participant records, maintaining data accuracy for effective communication.
    * Highlights: Provides validation for input formats, such as emails and gives feedback when inputs are incorrect, ensuring data integrity
