#### Enhancements implemented
### Milestone 1.0
* **New Feature**: Added TransactionList class
    * What it does: creates an ArrayList to hold both expenses and incomes
* **New Feature**: Added abilities to search for transactions in TransactionList via multiple ways 
    * What it does: creates a arrayList to store all the transactions made by the user. This class contains various search methods, allowing user to search for transactions made between a time period, and by category.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Change the date and time attribute to String dateTimeString for easier serialisation.

### Milestone 2.0 and 2.1
* **New Feature**: Added Keywords Search functionalities for TransactionList using Inverted Index Algorithm [PR85](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/85)
  * What it does: allows user to search for past transactions based on keywords. The result is sorted based on the number of keywords match

* **New Feature**: Added Storage Class [PR91](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/91)
  * What it does: it allows users to serialise the current transactionList to JSON and save locally when there's an update to the TransactionList. It also deserialise the JSON back and load the TransactionList when the programme initiates.
  * Credits: The implementation is the external library Gson by Google. Also, Gson by default does not support polymorphism, hence a helper class RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory is created. This implementation is based on https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/extras/src/main/java/com/google/gson/typeadapters/RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory.java.

* **Enhancements to existing features**
  * Added save and load functionality for budgetTracker [PR129](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/129)
  * Added functionality to show monthly income and expense on UI during initialisation. [PR149](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/149)
  * Added upper limits for user input (amount <= 1000000000 per transaction or budget and number of char <= 40 per description) [PR209](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/209) [PE210](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-4/tp/pull/210)
