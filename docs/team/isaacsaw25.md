### v1.0 Enhancements: `UI` Class, `PrintStudentList` Method Design Improvement
- User Interface (`UI`) Development
    - Developed the UI class to obtain user inputs and output responses from the program. Adopt a facade pattern
      between the logical backend elements (commands, student allocation logic, etc.) and the user interface. Created a
      enum `Messages`.

- `PrintStudentList()` Method Design Improvement
    - Identified and fixed a design flaw in the `printStudentList()` method that caused strange order of method calls 
  between classes. 

### v2.0 Enhancements: `Revert` command
- Revert Command Implementation
    - Designed and implemented the RevertCommand class to allow for undoing allocations,
      resetting each studentâ€™s allocation status and university index. Integrated logging and
      assertions to ensure system reliability.
