### Enhancements implemented:
I implemented the following classes, exceptions and functions which handle backend data storage, reminder functionality,
execution of commands, and JUnit testing.

I was responsible for integrating SaveFile functionality, exception checking, and data parsing, to **all functions** 
of the program, including those implemented by other members.

I was also responsible for establishing and enforcing data storage paradigms across my team members' work, 
such as parsing methods associated to the `Saveable `abstract class (`toSaveString` / `fromSaveString`) and program initialisation.

I partially reimplemented Ayushi Yadav's original work pertaining to dietary management (`FoodEntry`, `WaterEntry`, 
`FoodEaterIntake`, and associated functionalities) to increase disk-storage functionality. 

I wrote for all JUnit tests applicable to the methods I added within these classes.

## Documentation:
### User Guide:

Documented the following features: Data initialisation, Add Reminder, List Reminders, List Upcoming Reminders, Delete Reminder.

For each feature, I detailed its purpose, format, constraints, and included examples of its expected output.

### Developer Guide:


- Documented the Reminder class, designing sequence diagrams for Add Reminder, List Reminders, List Upcoming Reminders, 
and Delete Reminder functionality.
- Designed the Class diagram used to support the explanation of Storage functions.

## Project Management:
### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Led group discussions and final-stage (v2.0-) project planning - allocating tasks and assignments during meetings.
- Reviewed and (re)implemented significant portions of object classes (i.e `TrainingSession`, `Goal`, `User`) and `Parser` logic contributed by other team members on a rolling basis.   
- Led conflict-resolution to assuage early miscommunications, and establish clear lines of communication that were used heavily from the midpoint of the project thereafter.

### Review/mentoring contributions:
Jointly responsible for reviewing codebase quality across team member contributions, and enforcing code-quality and documentation standards.
