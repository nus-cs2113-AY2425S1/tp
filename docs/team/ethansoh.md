## Project: Flashbang

Flashbang is a command line interface(CLI) application for university students to be able to create and organise 
flashcards, and test themselves on said flashcards. The program is completely written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature:** Added a search command.
  - What it does: Allows users to search for flashcards based 
    on a search term which either searches between the topic of the card or the content
  - Justification: This feature makes organisation of cards significantly easier as users can identify cards containing
    certain words or topics
- **New Feature:** Added deleting by modules
  - What it does: Allows users to delete whole modules from all their flashcards
  - Justification: Makes deleting flashcards much more significant especially when sets of flashcards 
    are no longer relevant for students
  - Highlights: This enhances the delete command by creating optionality in how users are able to delete content.

- **Project Management:**
  - Task assignment during the project to ensure that all members had clear tasks to do during the project
  - Managed releases: `v1.0` - `v2.1` on GitHub
  - Manage code quality 
- **Enhancements to existing features:**
  - Added option to include topics when adding flashcards for better organisation and searching (Pull Request [#48](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/48))
  - Added optionality to the delete feature (Pull Request [#203](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/203))
- **Documentation:**
  - User Guide:
    - Added user documentation for features `search` (Pull Request [#171](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/171/files))
  - Developer Guide:
    - Added documentation of the project scope, user stories, non-functional requirements, glossary and instructions for manual testing
    - Added design and implementation details of the `Command` structure in the program
- **Community:**
  - Ensure code follows checkstyle configuration ([#74](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/74), [#176](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/176))
