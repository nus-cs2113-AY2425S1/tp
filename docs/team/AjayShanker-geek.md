## Project: MediTask

MediTask is a desktop application designed to help nurses efficiently manage and track their daily tasks via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This CLI tool streamlines task management, allowing nurses to quickly organize, monitor, and complete tasks, ensuring no important steps are missed.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### **New Feature:** `Storage` Functionality
  - **What it does**: Provides data persistence for patients and tasks information, allowing the system to save and load data from disk with use of [Jackson Library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to improve scalability and reliability in mind.
  - **Justification**: Enables nurses to store patient and task data across sessions, ensuring data integrity and continuity.
  - **Highlights**: Implemented `Storage` classes for patients and tasks, including methods for reading and writing data to disk. The system supports automatic data loading on startup and error handling for file I/O operations, ensuring robust data management.

#### **New Feature: `Json Utility`**
  - **What it does**: Coverts `Hospital` object <-> JSON for seamless data persistence that follows the API formate.
  - **Justification**: This will allow the system to save and load data from disk in JSON format.

#### **New Feature: `Storage Backup`**
  - **What it does**: Provides a backup mechanism for the system's data, allowing nurses to restore data in case of accidental deletion or corruption without overwritting important data.
  - **Justification**: Ensures data integrity and reliability by providing a safety net for critical information.

#### **New Feature: `Storage Deserialization`**
  - **What it does**: Ensure no duplication and invalid data is loaded into the system.
  - **Justification**: Prevents data corruption and ensures data consistency by validating loaded data before updating the system.
  - **Highlights**: Implemented data validation checks during deserialization to prevent duplication and invalid data from being loaded into the system. Use Jackson Library to deserialize with buildin `DeserializationFeature` like `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` to ensure data integrity.

#### **New Feature: State Management with `StateManager` Class**
  - **What it does**: Centralizes state management for the system, allowing for easy state transitions and command execution based on the current state.
  - **Justification**: Simplifies command execution and improves system organization by enforcing state-dependent operations.

#### **New Feature: Added `HelpCommand` & `ExitCommand`**
  - **What it does**: Provides a help command to display available commands and their usage, and an exit command to gracefully terminate the application.
  - **Justification**: Enhances user experience by providing guidance on command usage and ensuring a smooth application exit process.

#### **New Feature: `Colors` class**
  - **What it does**: Adds color-coded output to the CLI for improved readability and visual distinction between different types of information.
  - **Justification**: Enhances user experience by making the CLI output more visually appealing and easier to interpret.

#### **New Feature: `Messages` class**
  - **What it does**: Centralizes system messages improving maintainability.
  - **Justification**: Ensures consistent messaging across the application, making it easier to update and manage system messages.
