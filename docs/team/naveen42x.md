### Main Classes and Structure

- **Primary Class Structure and Relationships**:
  - Created key classes: `QuizResults`, `Storage`, `QuizResultsTest`, `StorageTest`, `QuizTimerTest`.
  - Designed and maintained the `QuizResults` class, facilitating the storage and retrieval of quiz outcomes while managing data persistence.
  - Implemented the `Storage` class for efficient file operations, ensuring smooth loading, saving, and initialization of data from external files.
  - Followed object-oriented principles to make the code modular and maintainable.
