## Overview
Pharmacy Inventory & Logistics Ledger (PILL) is a desktop application that allows pharmacists to keep track of and manage medicinal inventory.

PILL is fully written in Java, and users can interact with the application using Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature**: Added `AddItemCommand`, `DeleteItemCommand`, and `EditItemCommand`
    - **What it does**: Implements commands to add, delete, and edit items in the inventory. Each command has enhanced parsing logic to support multi-word item names and item names ending with integers (e.g., `add iPhone 16 999 2020-12-12`).
    - **Justification**: These commands are crucial for allowing pharmacists to manage inventory items efficiently, with flexible input handling that mirrors real-world scenarios.
    - **Highlights**: Developing the parsing logic was complex, especially distinguishing between item names, quantities, and expiry dates. Ensured the commands handle edge cases and invalid input gracefully.

- **New Feature**: Enhanced Cost and Price Management, added `cost` and `price` Commands
    - **What it does**: Implements features for setting and updating the cost and price of items, ensuring these values are formatted.
    - **Justification**: Accurate cost and price representation is essential for financial management in a pharmacy.
    - **Highlights**: Added comprehensive validation for input and adjusted methods to ensure consistent formatting. Fixed related bugs to improve the overall reliability of these features.

- **New Feature**: Implemented `Restock` and `RestockAll` Commands
    - **What it does**: Automates the restocking process for items below a certain stock level, either for a specific item or all items in the inventory.
    - **Justification**: Helps pharmacists efficiently manage inventory and prevent stockouts by identifying items that need restocking.
    - **Highlights**: Developed logic to calculate restocking costs and handle cases where items have no cost set. Improved usability with clear user feedback.

- **New Feature**: Developed the `Visualizer` Class for Data Visualization, added `visualize-cost`, `visualize-price`, `visualize-cost-price` and `visualize-stock` Commands
    - **What it does**:  Creates graphical charts using the XChart library to visualize item data, including prices, costs, and stock levels. Additionally, added a feature to compare costs and prices side-by-side.
    - **Justification**: Enhances user experience by providing visual insights into inventory data, making it easier for pharmacists to understand and manage their stock efficiently.
    - **Highlights**: The development involved processing item data to handle expiry dates properly and ensuring that charts were clear and intuitive.
