#### Features Implemented
- Created the base Ui class ([PR #36](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/36))
  - Ui class handles user interaction, by taking in user input and displaying output messages
  - Improved Ui to re-prompt user for input if user input is empty ([PR #64](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/64))
- Created Edit Command for editing recipes ([PR #69](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/69))
  - Allow users to edit a pre-existing recipe with new parameters (e.g. different list of ingredients)
  - Allow the different types of parameters of a recipe to be edited independently ([PR #216](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/216))
- Created Random Command for showing user a random recipe ([PR #134](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/134))
  - Choose a random recipe from the recipe database to display
- Created Recommend Command to show user recipes based on their available ingredients ([PR #134](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/134))
  - Check the ingredient database for available ingredients, then find available recipes with common ingredients
  - Only recipes from the database with common ingredients from the ingredient database are displayed
  - Recipes are listed in descending order of percentage of the recipe's ingredients that match the ingredient database
  - Percent match of the ingredients and missing ingredients are also shown to the user
