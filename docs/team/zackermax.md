### Enhancements implemented:
I implemented the following classes, exceptions and functions which handle data logging and storage, user interfacing and execution of commands.
This code forms the core of the program and allowed my team to build upon it to implement their features. 
I also wrote the JUnit tests for the code I wrote within these classes.

| Class            | Functionality                                                                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FitTrack         | Entry point of the application, manages application initialization by coordinating other classes             |
| FitTrackLogger   | Manages logging for the application, ensuring errors and important events are properly recorded              |
| User             | Records the user’s information, such as age and gender, and provides methods to modify or retrieve this data |
| Parser           | Handles parsing of user input, converting it into commands and actions                                       |
| Ui               | Handles user interaction and CLI output, printing messages and data to the console                           |
| ParserExceptions | Handles all exception handling for the Parser class. Effectively all I/O error handling.                     |

| Function                         | Purpose                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Configuration               | Set the age and gender of the user for use in NAPFA points calculation.                                     |
| Help Function                    | Prints a complete list of valid commands to aid the user in use of the application.                         |
| Add a Training Session           | Adds a Training Session with the specified name to allow the user to track their training progess.          |
| Modify Training Session DateTime | Modifies the DateTime of an existing Training Session.                                                      |
| List all Training Sessions       | Displays all Training Sessions the user has added.                                                          |
| View a Training Session          | View the details of a Training Session, including session name, datetime, exercise data, points and awards. |
| Edit a Training Session          | Edit the details of a training session, namely exercise and reps/time.                                      |

## Documentation:
### User Guide:

Documented the following features: User initialisation, Help function, Add Training Session, Modify Taining Session,
List all Training Sessions, View a Training Session, Edit a Training Session, Delete a Training Session and Exiting the program.

For each feature, I detailed its Purpose, Format, an Example and its Expected Output.

### Developer Guide:  

Documented the Project Architecture with an Architecture Diagram and Overall Class Diagram.

Documented Set User, Add Training Session, Modify Training Session, Delete Training Session, List Training Session 
and View Training Session, with a sequence diagram for each.

Wrote the User Stories to give better perspective on project requirements and direction
