## Overview
EventManagerCLI is a desktop CLI application meant for managing small-scale events organised by one person. It is written in Java, and has around 4kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New feature**: Added a parser for user input.
  * What it does: parses user input into executable commands.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to enter executable commands.
  * Highlights: This feature was used and built upon by others as additional commands were implemented.

* **New feature**: Added the ability to mark/unmark events as done.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark events as done or not done.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to flag out completed or past events as done.
  * Highlights: This feature required the updating of multiple existing commands and methods to work.

* **New feature**: Added the ability to mark/unmark participants as present.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark event participants as present or absent.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to track attendance for his events.
  * Highlights: This feature required the creation of a new class for event participants, and significant changes were required to existing methods that modified the participant list.

* **New feature**: Added a list of items for each event.
  * What it does: allows the user to add, remove, and mark items in a list for a specified event.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to track what materials he needs for an event.
  * Highlights: This feature required the modification of multiple existing commands, and changes had to be made in several areas (like for the command parsing) to enable this feature.
