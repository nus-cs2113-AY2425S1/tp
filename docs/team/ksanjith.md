## Overview
Your Mother's Favourite Cookbook (YMFC) is a desktop app for managing recipes, designed for use through the
Command Line Interface (CLI). YMFC can help you manage all your recipes with ease, using the simplicity of the CLI, and
keep track of what ingredients you have on hand.

#### Features Implemented
- Created the base Command Class and RecipeList class ([PR #39](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/39))
  - The Command Class acts as an abstract class for all other specific command classes to inherit from.
  - The RecipeList class deals with Recipe objects created by the user, such as storing and modifying them.
- Created Exception classes ([PR #51](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/51))
  - Wrote 3 different exception classes for different uses and 1 main parent exception class for them to inherit from 
- Created Storage Class ([PR #56](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/56))
  - The Storage class deals with the storage of user created recipes and ingredients on a local file
  - Wrote code to allow YMFC to save and load recipes using a local .txt file.
- Created Sort Command ([PR #67](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/67))
  - Wrote code to allow users to sort their recipes either alphabetically (by name) or numerically (by time taken).
- Created Sort Ingredients Command ([PR #142](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/142))
  - Wrote code to allow users to sort their ingredients alphabetically (by name).

#### Enhancements Implemented
- Created additional tests for existing classes and methods to increase overall coverage ([PR #81](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/81)) 
  - Total Class Coverage improved from 58% to 91%
  - Total Method Coverage improved from 47% to 77%
  - Total Line Coverage improved from 46% to 71%
  - Total Branch Coverage improved from 40% to 54%
- Expanded on the Help Command's output to better explain all the available commands and their usage ([PR #79](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/79))
- Started using EmptyListException to throw exceptions when user is trying to modify, search, sort or delete
from an empty recipe list ([PR #81](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/81))
- Started using InvalidSaveLineException for when there are invalid lines found in the save file during load ([PE #215](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/215))
- Enhanced and expanded the save-load system to be more robust in finding irregular lines in save file and
to immediately overwrite the found irregular lines ([PE #215](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/215))
- to create blank save files upon first launch ([PE #217](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/217))

#### Contributions to the UG
- Wrote out the first skeleton draft of the UG that contained basic descriptions of all features within YMFC ([PR #88](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/88))
- Wrote the Command Summary Section
- Contributed to the Usage section
- Expanded the explanation of the save-load system ([PE #219](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/219))
- Expanded the explanation of the difference between cookbook and inventory lists ([PE #219](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/pull/219))
