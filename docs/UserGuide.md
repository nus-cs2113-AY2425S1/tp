### Updating Rental Status of Car

There is no need to manually update the rental status of a car. 
The status will be updated automatically when a transaction record is:

### Adding a Transaction: `add-tx`

Adds a new rental transaction to the system.

To add transaction bearing either an existing license plate number and/or customer name, all previous transactions containing either both or one of the parameter must be either marked as completed or be removed from the transaction list.
It means that when a customer and a car are in a transaction, either that customer or that car cannot involve in other transactions, including transactions with different time periods (start date - end date), unless that transaction is marked as completed or be removed from the transaction list.

**Format:** `add-tx /c [LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER] /u [CUSTOMER_NAME] /d [DURATION] /s [START_DATE: dd-MM-yyyy]`

- `/c` identifier specifies the license plate number of the car the customer wants to rent.
- `LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER` must match an existing car in the database. This is unique as the program will not allow 2 cars to have the same license plate number.


- `/u` identifier specifies the name of the customer.
- `CUSTOMER_NAME` must match an existing customer in the database. This is unique as the program will not allow 2 customers to have the same name.


- `/d` identifier specifies the duration of the rental in days.
- `DURATION` must be an integer between 1 and 365 (inclusive). This allows the rental companies to handle rental transactions from 1 day to 365 days (a year).


- `/s` identifier specifies the start date of the rental.
- `START_DATE` is in the format of [dd-MM-yyyy], accepting integers input only. It must be a valid date in the calendar.

**Example:**  
`add-tx /c SZZ1579D /u John /d 15 /s 11-05-2025`

**Sample Response:**
```
Transaction added:
[ ] TX2 | SZZ1579D | John | 15 days
Start Date: 11-05-2025 | End Date: 26-05-2025
```
---
### Removing a Transaction: `remove-tx`
