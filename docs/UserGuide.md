## Introduction
BookBob is a desktop application tailored for Dr Bob's private General Practitioner clinic. BookBob helps 
streamline clinic management by storing and retrieving patient information, including names, NRICs, genders, dates of 
birth, phone numbers, home addresses, allergies, medical histories and detailed visit records with diagnoses and 
prescribed medications. BookBob also assists Dr Bob in staying organised by tracking daily appointments and sending 
reminders each morning. Optimised for a Command Line Interface (CLI), BookBob enables efficient management of patient 
information and appointment scheduling.

## Adding a Patient Record
Adds a new patient record to BookBob. <br>
Format: add n/NAME ic/NRIC [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [d/DIAGNOSIS] [m/MEDICATION] [ha/HOME_ADDRESS] [dob/DATE_OF_BIRTH] v/VISIT_DATE_TIME [al/ALLERGY] [s/SEX] [mh/MEDICALHISTORY] <br>

Note : <br>
• Mandatory fields (name, NRIC, visit date and time) require user input to add a patient successfully. If any of
these fields are missing, an error message will prompt the user to provide the missing inputs.<br>
• Optional fields (denoted by square brackets above) include phone number, diagnoses, medications, home address, date of
birth, allergies, sex and medical histories. <br>
• If an input is incorrectly formatted but mandatory fields are correctly filled, the patient will still be added,
with incorrectly formatted fields left empty and other inputs unaffected. <br>
• Single diagnosis, medication, allergy and medical history can be added; <u>Multiple diagnoses, medications, allergies and/or medical histories are also allowed</u>, by separating them with commas. <br>
• "add" command does <u>not allow</u> for adding <u>future Dates&Time</u>. Consider scheduling an appointment instead. <br>
• Parameters entered in the input can be of <u>any order</u> or you may also choose to stick to the format above. <br>

• Each field requires custom logic to validate inputs and printing meaningful error messages for the users. Examples:<br>
1. Names can only contain alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), hyphens, slashes, commas and spaces.
2. a Singapore NRIC must be 9 characters long, starting with "S" or "T", containing numbers in the middle and ending with an alphabet) (case-insensitive).<br>
Duplicate NRIC entries are not allowed.
3. Date of birth must be in the format: dd-MM-yyyy
4. Sex can only be "F", "Female", "M" or "Male" (case-insensitive).
5. a Singapore phone number must be 8 digits long and start with "8" or "9")
6. Home addresses can only contain alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, spaces and hyphens.
7. Visit date and time must be in the format: dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm <br>

Example: `add n/James Ho ic/S9534567A p/91234567 d/Asthma m/Albuterol ha/NUS-PGPR dob/31-01-1995 v/21-10-2024 15:48 al/Pollen s/Female mh/Diabetes`

Example Output: 
```
Patient James Ho with NRIC S9534567A added.
```

Additional examples:
* `add n/Patricia Chan ic/S9890897U v/04-11-2024 09:00` - Adds a patient with only mandatory fields inputted.
* `add n/Jacky Cheung ic/S7209876Y ha/Farrer Road p/98765789 v/06-11-2024 14:00` - Adds a patient with mandatory fields
and optional fields with a different order as the format above.

The examples above result in successful patient record additions, which are then saved automatically.

<div style="background-color: #F5F9FE; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; color: #1A1A1A;">
💡 <b>Best Practices of using</b> <em><strong>"add" command together with "addVisit" command</strong></em> <b>:</b> <br>
1.) When a new patient visits the clinic, we use <b>"add" command</b>. <br>
<ins> The "add" command is primarily used for adding a patient record with the patient's basic key details information </ins> (such as Name , NRIC , Phone Number), and that Name, NRIC, Patient's First Visit Date, are <ins>Compulsory fields</ins>. <br>
Other <ins>Optional fields</ins> includes e.g. Phone Number, Home Address, DOB, <i>and</i> Diagnoses and Medications from patient's first visit. <br>
<br>
2.) If the <ins>same patient(with same NRIC)</ins> comes back to the clinic for a new visit, we use <b>"addVisit" command</b>,  
to key in the visit Date&Time of this new visit event(which is a compulsory field along with NRIC), AND the Diagnoses of illnesses and Medications prescribed for this new visit event (which are optional fields).<br>
<br>
3.) We then use "list" command to see all patient information.
</div>

## Listing All Patient Records
Lists all patient records saved. <br>
Format: `list`

Example Output:
```
Name: James Ho, NRIC: S9534567A, Phone: 91234567, Home Address: NUS-PGPR, DOB: 31-01-1990, Allergies: [Pollen], Sex: Female, Medical Histories: [Diabetes]
Visit Date: 21-10-2024 15:48, Diagnosis: [Asthma], Medications: [Albuterol]

Name: Patricia Chan, NRIC: S90890897U, Phone: , Home Address: , DOB: , Allergies: [], Sex: , Medical Histories: []
Visit Date: 04-11-2024 09:00, Diagnosis: [], Medications: []

Name: Jacky Cheung, NRIC: S7209876Y, Phone: 98765789, Home Address: Farrer Road, DOB: , Allergies: [], Sex: , Medical Histories: []
Visit Date: 06-11-2024 14:00, Diagnosis: [], Medications: []
```
<br>

<div style="background-color: #F5F9FE; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; color: #1A1A1A;">
🚨 <b>NOTE:</b> The example below is achieved by executing the commands in this exact order; <b>"add" followed by "addVisit" followed by "list"</b>.
Not by using the "add" command multiple times followed by "list".
</div>

Additional Example Output of the <u>same Patient(with same NRIC)</u> with multiple <u>new visits</u> during <u>different dates</u>, 
with different illness diagnosed and medications prescribed during the different visit event : 

```
Name: Wang Ritz, NRIC: S8634567A, Phone: 91234567, Home Address: PGPR, DOB: 31-02-1990, Allergies: [grass], Sex: female, Medical Histories: [diabetes]
    Visit Date: 20-10-1995 12:35, Diagnosis: [], Medications: []
    Visit Date: 21-10-2004 15:48, Diagnosis: [Fever, Headache, Flu], Medications: [Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Aspirin]
    Visit Date: 29-09-2020 23:59, Diagnosis: [Fatigue, Dizziness, Cough], Medications: [Mint, Mentos, Coke]

## Finding a Patient Record
<div style="background-color: #F5F9FE; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; color: #1A1A1A;">
🚨 <b>Note:</b> this "find" command is to search for standard patient information and details.<br><br>
BookBob has dedicated commands namely findAppointment, findVisit, findMedication, findDiagnosis, which you can read about in the next sections below.
</div>

"find" Searches for patient records based on search parameters such as name, NRIC, phone number, home address, date of birth, allergies, sex, or medical history.<br>

- n/NAME
- ic/NRIC
- p/PHONE_NUMBER
- ha/HOME_ADDRESS
- dob/DATE_OF_BIRTH
- al/ALLERGY
- s/SEX
- mh/MEDICAL_HISTORY <br>
<br>
**Note** : <br>
- "find" Trims Leading spaces and Trailing spaces. But there are <u>no spaces</u> anywhere in <u>between Prefix/Value</u>.  <br>

Examples:
* `find n/John` - Finds all patients whose names contain "John"

Example Output:
```
Matching patients:
Name: John Doe, NRIC: S9534567A, Phone: 91234567, Home Address: Clementi Road, DOB: 01-01-1990, Allergies: [Peanuts], Sex: Male, Medical Histories: [Asthma]

## Appendix A: Miscellaneous
**• Regarding a “global universal in-sync time check” to prevent any Date&Time clashes at all** <br>
BookBob currently guards against duplicate exact Date&Time clashes for the following situations : <br>
1.) Same patient entering a new visit at the clinic, at the exact same Date&Time of a previous visit. <br>
2.) Appointment clashes, e.g. different Patients(or even same patient) attempting to schedule an appointment with a timeslot that has already been occupied. <br>
• BookBob will prompt patient to schedule at the next available time. <br>

BookBob currently does not guard against duplicate exact Date&Time clashes for the following situations :<br>
1.) Scheduled Appointment time and a Walk-in consultation visit at the same exact time. <br>
Reason : It could be possible that a patient with an emergency visited the clinic. We cannot reject/deny/decline such emergency unscheduled walk-in patients. <br>
2.) Walk-in consultation visits of two different patients at the exact same time. <br>
Reason : It could be possible that the two patients arrived at the clinic with emergencies. We cannot reject/deny/decline such emergency unscheduled walk-in patients.
