## Introduction

Inventra is a command-driven logistics and inventory management system design for small to
medium-sized businesses including but not limited to: warehouses, online shops, retail
businesses. Optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI), Inventra aims to provide
precise inventory management, real-time tracking and automation of tasks.

## Quick Start

1. Prerequisites: Ensure Java 17 or above is installed in your Computer.
   2. Download: the latest [.jar] file from this [link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1). 
3. Setup:
*  Copy [.jar] file to the folder you would like to store your program to. 
*  Open command terminal, [cd] into directory [.jar] is stored
4. Run the application:
   ``` java -jar Inventra.jar ```
5. Getting Started:
*  Once launched the program, type `help` for user manual will be displayed. 
Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

## Features 

Notes about commands' convention:
1. Program function keywords are `help`, `add`, `view`, `delete` , `update` and `exit`
2. Most key words will require flags via a dash, an alphabet followed by valid input
   e.g view [FLAG] [VALID INPUT]
3. Some key words won't require flags: help, delete 1, exit
3. Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be supplied by the user.
   e.g in add -h FIELD1, FIELD2…
4. Items with “...” after them can be used multiple times
   e.g in add -d DATA1, DATA2…
5. Any extra parameters defined after the following commands: view -a, delete -a, delete -e, exit will be
   ignored.
6. All inputs to inventory is limited to 20 characters, this is to save space and preserve table Ui
7. Please note that you do not need to consider index(ID) number when adding fields/records. 
It is assigned and maintained automatically by the system.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?  
**A**: Copy `data/inventory.csv` file to its new desired location.
Ensure that the file remains in the same directory as `inventra.jar` file when running the application on the new computer.  

**Q**: Why can't I input more than 20 characters when adding a field or record?  
**A**: This is to ensure efficient use of space and to ensure that output table format is preserved.  

## Known Issues

1. Extra Input: Additional values provided after expected inputs for commands like `view -a`, `exit` will be ignored.
2. Case Sensitivity: Ensure correct lowercase input as commands are case-sensitive.
3. Pending Features: Increasing limitations of 20 character fields and records with dynamic output table Ui.
