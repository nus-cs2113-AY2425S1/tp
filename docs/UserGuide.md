## Features

{: .important }
> ℹ️ Notes about the command format:
>
>- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as help.
>
>- Parameters cannot be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `add Alice /tag HighPriority`, `/tag HighPriority add Alice` is not acceptable.
>
>- Ensure that Patient is selected before entering any task-related commands. e.g. `select 1` before adding a task or simply look above the prompt `Patient: <patient_name>`.
>
>- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
> - **Dates and Times** (only in the `deadline` command) must follow specific formats:
>   - **Date Formats:**

### Saving data

MediTask data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

MediTask data is saved as a JSON file [JAR file location]/data/hospital_data.json. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

{: .warning }
> ⚠️ Caution: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MediTask will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it
>
> Furthermore, certain edits can cause the MediTask to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range or data entered is a duplicate, etc.). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?
