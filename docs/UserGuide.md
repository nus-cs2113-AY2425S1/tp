# User Guide

## Introduction

Introducing ExchangeCourseMapper, the perfect assistant in your planning for your SEP in Oceania!

Using ExchangeCourseMapper, you can search and plan your course mapping by listing the universities of interest, 
along with the specific courses and subject codes offered by each school. You can quickly filter by NUS-coded modules 
or by partner universities (PU) when you want to view the relevant options. For any course mappings you are interested in,
you can save it in the Personal Tracker provided by ExchangeCourseMapper!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `ExchangeCourseMapper` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W10-2/tp/releases/).
3. Download the JAR file and save it on your computer.
4. Copy the absolute path of where the jar file is saved.
5. In Terminal, run java -jar /path/to/ExchangeCourseMapper.jar
6. Time to start your planning!

## Features 

> **NOTE:** Your stored course mapping is located in the `myList.json` file, found in the `data` folder at the 
> same file path where you executed the JAR file.
> 
> **NOTE:** The `myList.json` file will only be created after you have executed the JAR file at least once.
> A new file will be created after every execution if no `myList.json` file is found in the `data` folder at the
> same file path where you executed the JAR file.
>
> **NOTE:** Ensure that all the commands given are placed in **one line**. 
> Do not separate the command into multiple lines in the terminal.
> 
> **NOTE:** For all command flags, ensure that your input is placed a single space after the flag.
> 
> **NOTE:** If the file is **corrupted**, please restore it to its **original state** before proceeding with the program.
> 
>You may try one of the following:
>- Remove the corrupted line (delete one course mapping).
>- Remove any empty lines in the file.
>- Ensure the file has one empty line at the end of the list of courses for a new course to be added.
>
> **This list is non-exhaustive.**
> 
> **TIP:** You may use the partner universities' **official abbreviation** instead of typing the full name into the CLI, 
> as shown in the chart below:
> - The University of Melbourne - unimelb
> - The Australian National University - anu
> - Victoria University of Wellington - wgtn
> - The University of Western Australia - uwa
