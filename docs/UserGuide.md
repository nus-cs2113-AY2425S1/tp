# User Guide

## Introduction

SpendSwift is a simple budgeting tool designed for budget-conscious users.
With intuitive text commands, you can effortlessly track expenses and manage your finances
without the complexity of traditional tools.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest `[CS2113-T10-4][SpendSwift].jar` file.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder where you placed the jar file,
   and run the following command to start the application: `java -jar "[CS2113-T10-4][SpendSwift].jar".`
5. The application will start, and any existing expenses, categories and budgets will be loaded from the folder
   spendswift with 2 text files in it, expense.txt and category.txt.
   - If this file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when expenses, categories and budgets are saved
     after exiting the program properly.
6. Type commands below the outputs and press Enter to execute them.

Your command terminal should look similar to the one below.

## Features
### Command Format Notes
1. Commands are case-insensitive: Command words can be typed in any combination of upper or lower case.

   Example: `add-expense` and `ADD-EXPENSE` are both valid.
2. Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be supplied by the user.

   Example: In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter, which can be used as `add n/Udon`.

3. All parameters must be provided for commands that require them.

   Example: In `add-expense n/NAME a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY`, you must provide the expense name, amount and category,
   such as `add-expense n/Coffee a/5.50 c/Drinks`

4. Order of parameters: Parameters can be provided in any order. However, please note that a valid command must be input first. 

   Example: `add-expense n/Coffee a/5.50 c/Food` is equivalent to `add-expense a/5.50 n/Coffee c/Food`. However, `n/Coffee add-expense a/5.50 c/Food` would produce an error.

5. Extraneous parameters that appear after commands which do not take in parameters (such as `view-expenses` and `bye`) 
   will be ignored.

   Example: If the command specifies `view-expenses 123`, it will be interpreted as `view-expenses`. However, `123 view-expense` would produce an error.

6. Avoid using command prefixes (e.g., `n/`, `a/`, `c/`, etc.) and special character `|` within parameter values, as they may interfere with parsing.

   Example: `add-expense n/Coffee 2023/02/12 a/5.50 c/Food` is valid, but `n/Coffee a/s/a/a/a/ a/5.50 c/Food` is not,
   as `a/` is used within the `NAME` parameter, causing confusion with the `a/AMOUNT` prefix.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?
**A**: Copy the `spendswift` folder from your SpendSwift home folder to the same folder on your new computer.
Ensure the `[CS2113-T10-4][SpendSwift].jar` file is also in the same folder. When you start the application on the new computer,
it will load your saved expenses and categories from `spendswift`.

**Q**: What happens if I enter an invalid command or make a typo?  
**A**: SpendSwift will display an error message if it doesn't recognize the command.
Double-check the command format and ensure all required parameters are included.
You can type `help` to see the correct command syntax and available options.

**Q**: Can I update or change an expenseâ€™s details after adding it?  
**A**: Currently, SpendSwift doesn't support direct editing of expenses.
To make changes, delete the existing expense using `delete-expense` and add a new one with the updated details.

**Q**: How are expenses rounded off if I enter an amount with more than two decimal places?  
**A**: SpendSwift automatically rounds amounts to two decimal places.
