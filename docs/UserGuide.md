## Introduction

Your Mother's Favourite Cookbook (YMFC) is a desktop app for managing recipes, designed for use through the
Command Line Interface (CLI). YMFC can help you manage all your recipes with ease, using the simplicity of the CLI.
It can also keep track of what ingredients you have on hand, and recommend recipes based on what you can make. 

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `YMFC` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-1/tp/releases).
3. Open a command line terminal (`Terminal` on Linux and macOS, `Command Prompt` on Windows).
4. Navigate to the directory where YMFC.jar is saved at.
   - You can use the `cd` command to navigate to the proper directory.
5. Type in `java -jar YMFC.jar` in the command line terminal to launch YMFC. 
6. Use commands listed in the [Features](#features).
7. Type `bye` to exit YMFC.

## Features

### Auto-Save Databases
* YMFC keeps 2 separate databases, stored locally in 2 text files.
  * The cookbook database stores your Recipes, located at `[JAR File Location]/data/recipes.txt`.
  * The inventory database stores your available Ingredients, located at `[JAR File Location]/data/ingredients.txt`.
* YMFC loads your recipes and ingredients from these 2 databases when launched
* If the databases don't yet exist, YMFC will create them automatically
* Your recipes and ingredients are saved automatically every time they are added, edited or removed

### Input Formatting Guide
* If the command format is in uppercase letters, then it means it is to be substituted for the user's desired phrase
  * Example: In the parameter `n/NAME`, the user is to replace "NAME" with another word/phrase of their liking
such as `n/ABC Soup`
* If the command format is in lowercase letter, then it must be used as it is and cannot be substituted
  * Example: In the parameter `s/name`, the command must be typed exactly as shown.
  * The word "name" cannot be replaced with anything else.
* The [ ] in `[PARAMETER]` means that the parameter in question is optional to add in the command.
* The ... in `PARAMETER...` means that there can be multiple of that parameter.
  * There must be at least 1 parameter included.
