## Introduction

Finance Buddy is a command-line interface application that allows university students
to log their daily expenditures to help manage their budgets.

Users can add, delete and edit income and expenditure logs into the app, as well as
list out all their logged transactions. Users are also able to set a monthly budget
for themselves in the app, and the app will notify them if
they have exceeded, or are close to exceeding their budget.

The current progress of the logging will be saved after each successful command.
Progress is restored when FinanceBuddy is started up each time.

Your Financial List will be stored in to `data/FinancialList.txt`, while your budget is stored in `data/Budget.txt`.
FinanceBuddy will automatically update the files whenever your list or budget been modified through FinanceBuddy.
When you start the FinanceBuddy program, it will check if the `data/FinancialList.txt` and `data/Budget.txt` exist.
If they do exist, they will try to load the transactions and budget in the file row by row.
Please do not modify these files manually, otherwise the transactions or the budget with incorrect format will not be loaded.
