#### Format of data storage for password:
For security purposes the method of storage will not be discussed. <span style="color:#f5220d">DO NOT</span> 
alter this file, simply exit the program and delete the file if you have forgotten you password and create a new password upon being 
prompt when start up. Note that this will cause a hard reset to the application and erase all data.

#### Format of data storage for income and spending:
Data are stored with `|` used as delimiter. Each line in the text file represents one entry. <br>
Format: 
`[$AMOUNT]|[$DESCRIPTION]|[$DATE_OF_ENTRY]|[TAG_NAME]|[RECURRENCE_FREQUENCY]|[LAST_RECURRENCE]|[DAY_OF_RECURRENCE]`
<br>
<br>
For spendings.txt, the first line of entry stores the budgets of the user.<br>
Format: `[$DAILY_BUDGET]|[$MONTLY_BUDGET]|[$YEARLY_BUDGET]` <br>
<br>
Important data representation to note:
+ `[$DESCRIPTION]`/`[$TAG]`: Must be free of /, *, ~ and \| characters.
- `[$AMOUNT]`/`[$DAILY_BUDGET]`/`[$MONTHLY_BUDGET]`/`[$YEARLY_BUDGET]`: In 2 decimal places.
- `[$DATE_OF_ENTRY]`: In the format of YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY must not be more than 100 years ago.
- `[$RECURRENCE_FREQUENCY]`: In the format of `NONE`/`DAILY`/`MONTHLY`/`YEARLY`.
- `[$DAY_OF_RECURRENCE]`: To match the day stored in `[$DATE_OF_ENTRY]`.

We recommend not to edit `[$LAST_RECURRENCE]`. However, if you wish to, for adding recurring entries, `[$LAST_RECURRENCE]`
should match `[$DATE_OF_ENTRY]` and for editing recurring entries, `[$LAST_RECURRENCE]` should be the last possible recurred date 
before current date. If the entry is not recurring, `[$LAST_RECURRENCE]` should be "null".

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **A**: Simply transfer `incomes.txt`, `spendings.txt` and `password.txt` files to the folder that the program 
is at.

**Q**: Why are the indices of the entries not in consecutive order when I list or find entries?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **A**: Each index reflects the actual index of the item in the entire list so that you can edit or delete the 
entry easily.

**Q**: What happens if I edit the date of a recurring entry to an earlier date?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **A**: The date of the entry will be changed, but no additional entries will be created between the new date and the 
current date.

**Q**: What happens if I add a recurring entry with an earlier date?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **A**: You will have the option to select whether you would like to add the additional entries between the date of entry and the current date.

**Q**: What happens if I forget my password?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **A**: Delete the `password.txt` file in the folder where the program is located. Upon starting the program, you will be prompted to create a new password.
Users have to press Ctrl+C (or Command+C for Mac users) to exit the program before they are able to delete the file.
Do note that the `spendings.txt` and `incomes.txt` files will be reset and all data will be lost.
