---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest .jar file from the Github Repository, under releases.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your expenses.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run the application.

---

## Notes

- Text written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` are user input fields.
- Text preceded with a `/` are flags that need to be inputted for the programme to recognise.
- Square brackets `[...]` indicate optional parameters. Refer to the specifications for each command.
- When passing in a value with forward slashes (`/`) into an argument, make sure to escape it with `\`.
  - e.g. `<command> /argument \/value` -> `argument`: `/value`
- Not all commands will give an output.

Format: `save [/expenseList EXPENSE_FILE_PATH] [/categoryInfo CATEGORY_FILE_PATH] [/recurringExpenseList RECUR_FILE_PATH]`

Notes:
- If nothing at all is specified, it loads from the default paths:
  - `EXPENSE_FILE_PATH = "expenses_data.csv"`
  - `CATEGORY_FILE_PATH = "category_spending_limit.csv"`
  - `RECUR_FILE_PATH = "recurring_expenses_data.csv"`
- If some of the fields are specified, only the corresponding field(s) are saved.
- The save files are designed to be human-readable and editable. Be careful of the syntax while editing!

Examples:
- `save`                         saves all data to the default paths.
- `save /expenseList ./data.csv` saves only the expenseList to `./data.csv`.

  - `CATEGORY_FILE_PATH = "category_spending_limit.csv"`
  - `RECUR_FILE_PATH = "recurring_expenses_data.csv"`
- It clears existing data on read for ease of usage.
- On read failure, it loads whatever it could read from the corrupted files.

Examples:
- `load`                         loads data from the default paths.
- `load /expenseList ./data.csv` loads only the expenseList from `./data.csv`.

## Recurring Expenses

Recurring expenses allow you to automate adding expenses that occur on a regular basis.

Recurring expenses are saved to a separate `recurringExpenseList`. They do not affect calculations and visualizations.
Only when you run the `load` command will these expenses generate "normal expenses"  and add them to the `expenseList`.

### Add a recurring expense: `add`

Adds a recurring expense to the system.

Format:  `add /recur /price PRICE /description DESCRIPTION /category CATEGORY /date DATE /frequency FREQUENCY`

Notes:
- `/recur` is a command flag indicating that the command is for a recurring expense.
- `PRICE` is a positive decimal number.
- `DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY` are text.
- `DATE` takes a text format of `DD-MM-YYYY`. If no `DATE` is specified, it will be defaulted to the current date.
- `FREQUENCY` takes only 1 of 3 possible inputs: `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`. Any other input will throw an error.

Examples: 
- `add /recur /price 4.50 /description chicken rice /category food /frequency daily`
- `add /recur /price 15 /description Spotify /category subscription /date 01-10-2024 /frequency monthly`

### Edit a recurring expense: `edit`

Allows you to edit a recurring expense.

Format: `edit INDEX /recur [/price PRICE] [/description DESCRIPTION] [/category CATEGORY] [/date DATE] [/frequency FREQUENCY]`

Notes:
- `INDEX` is an integer. Use the `list` command to find the corresponding index.
- `/recur` is a command flag indicating that the command is for a recurring expense.
- `PRICE` is a positive decimal number.
- `DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY` are text.
- `DATE` takes a text format of `DD-MM-YYYY`. If no `DATE` is specified, it will be defaulted to the current date.
- `FREQUENCY` takes only 1 of 3 possible inputs: `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`. Any other input will throw an error.
- All parameters except `INDEX` and `/recur` are optional. You can specify which attribute of the expense you want to edit.
 
Examples: 
- `edit 1 /recur /price 5.50 /description chicken rice /category food`
- `edit 2 /recur /price 3.40 /frequency monthly /date 02-10-2024`

### Delete a recurring expense: `delete`

Deletes a recurring expense. Use `list /recur` to find the corresponding index.

Format:  `delete /recur INDEX`

Example: `delete /recur 2` 

### Get a list of all your transactions: `list`

Use the list command to display recurring expenses according to specified filters.

Format:  `list /recur [/category CATEGORY] [/from FROM_DATE] [/to TO_DATE]`

Notes:
- `/recur` is a command flag indicating that the command is for a recurring expense.
- `CATEGORY` is text.
- `FROM_DATE` and `TO_DATE` are dates in `DD-MM-YYYY` format.
- Lists all recurring expenses that satisfy the given filter (if any).

Examples: `list /recur /category food /from 02-11-2024 /to 04-11-2024`

### Save data to files: `save`

Works the same way as normal expenses.

### Load data from files: `load`

On top of working the same way as normal expenses, this command also checks whether a recurring expense is past its due date and adds it as a normal expense to the expense list.

## FAQ

**Q1**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A1**: You can save your expenses to a `.csv` file, which you can then transfer and load on another computer 


**Q2**: Can I only update limits (via the set command)? What about adding, deleting or viewing?

**A2**: In short, yes. 

- Adding is automatically done when you add an expense with a category not already stored by the program, defaulted to $100.00. 
- Deletion is not possible as every category will have a corresponding limit. No category can exist without a limit.
- Viewing is not directly possible using commands, only indirectly by saving and viewing the csv file. 

**Q3**: Why don't my total expense per category reset at the start of every month?

**A3**: The backend currently does not support different totals per month, but it will be implemented soon.

**Q4**: Why does my total expenditure for this category not exactly match what I've calculated? /  Why does the alerts/warnings show up even though my total is not yet nearing or exceeding the limit?

**A4**: The backend uses floats to represent prices, which may cause inaccuracies when calculating total expenditures, or when determining .
