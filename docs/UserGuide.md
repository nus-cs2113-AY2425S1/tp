## Features

> ### Notes on Command format
>
> Text written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` are command parameters to be supplied by the user.
>
> Text preceded with a `/` will be read as flags. `/` is a reserved character and is not to be used as part of a parameter. e.g. `meal add /n Choc/Pie /c 200` will throw an invalid flag error.
>
> Square brackets `[...]` indicate optional parameters. e.g. `history view` and `history view 11-11-2024` are both valid.
>
> Flagged parameters can be supplied in any order. e.g. `meal add /n Pie /c 200` is equivalent to `meal add /c 200 /n Pie`
>
> Parameters can include spaces. e.g. `meal add /n Chicken Rice /c 200` is a valid command.
>
> All flags have aliases. Refer to the [alias table](#Alias-Table) to see the alternative options available for each flag.
>
> For date parameters, dates should be supplied in the `dd-MM-yyyy` format. e.g. `11-11-2024`
>
> Providing extra flags that are not specified by the User Guide will be ignored by BuffBuddy. e.g. `meal add /n Pie /c 200 /w 30` will produce the same result as `meal add /n Pie /c 200`.


> ### Terminology
>
> **Exercise**: A weighted exercise defined by a name, number of reps and sets, weight and average calories burned.
>
> **Day**: A ‘workout day’ is a collection of exercises to be done together.

_Note_: Advanced users can create a detailed programme with multiple days and exercises in one step by using the following command structure.

This allows users to add specific exercises with sets, reps, weight, and calorie details for each day:

**Command**: `prog create PROG_NAME /d DAY_NAME /e /n EXERCISE_NAME /s SETS /r REPS /w WEIGHT /c CALORIES /e ...`

**Example**: `prog create Advanced Starter /d Monday /e /n Bench Press /s 3 /r 15 /w 30 /c 200 /e /n Squat /s 3 /r 15 /w 50 /c 200 /d Wednesday /e /n Bicep Curl /s 3 /r 10 /w 10 /c 100`

> **Warning:** users should note that copy pasting this directly into terminal will break it into a multi-line input, which BuffBuddy does not recognize as a valid command.
> 
> Please copy paste the command into a text editor such as Notepad and fix the formatting before pasting it into the terminal.

## Data Storage

BuffBuddy uses a JSON file to store user data, ensuring persistence across sessions.

### Saving your data

- Saving is done automatically after each user command. It does not need to be manually triggered by a command.
- All records, including logged days, meals, and water intake, are saved in a structured format within a designated file (./data/data.json).
- The JSON format is human-readable, allowing users to view their stored data easily if needed.

### Loading your data

- Loading happens automatically when BuffBuddy initializes.
- If the structure of the JSON file has been tampered with (e.g., removing the "programmeList" key or using {} as the entire content), the program will handle this scenario by treating the user as a first-time user and initializing a fresh data file.
- If any data values within the JSON file are found to be invalid (e.g., negative numbers where only positive values are allowed), the specific section containing corrupted data (either the `ProgrammeList` or `History`) will be re-initialized to be empty.

### Editing the data file

- Users can directly edit the data file to easily change their records or import data from another file
- Users should note that they need to first exit BuffBuddy before making their changes. If the data file is edited while actively entering commands into BuffBuddy, the contents of the file will be overwritten.

## FAQ

1. **How can I back up my data?**

   - BuffBuddy saves data in a JSON file located at `./data/data.json`. You can create a backup by copying this file to
     another location.

2. **What happens if I accidentally delete or corrupt the data file?**

   - If the data file is deleted or corrupted, BuffBuddy will reset your program list and history to prevent data issues.
     However, restoring a backup of the JSON file (if you have one) can also recover your data.

3. **Can I add exercises that don’t involve weights?**

   - BuffBuddy currently only supports weighted exercises. Exercises like jumping jacks or other body weight exercises cannot
     be added without a weight parameter.

4. **What is the caloric balance in the history view?**

   - The caloric balance shows the difference between the calories burned through exercise and the calories consumed through
     meals, helping you monitor your energy intake and expenditure.

5. **What happens if I input invalid values for commands?**
   - BuffBuddy performs basic validation for parameters. Negative values or missing required parameters will prompt an error,
     and the command won’t be executed. Ensure all required fields are filled correctly.
