## Features

### 1. View Topics: `view`
Displays a list of all available quiz topics that you can attempt, such as loops, conditionals, and data types.

**Format**: `view`

**Example**:
   ```shell
   view
   ```

### 2. Select Topic and Start Quiz: `select`
This command allows you to select a specific topic or a random selection of topics to initiate a quiz. Before starting, you will be prompted to enter:
- A time limit for the quiz (in seconds or minutes) if the quiz is timed.
- The number of questions you wish to attempt.
- /d: Specifies whether the quiz should be timed or untimed
- /t: Specifies the topic for the quiz. You can provide a specific topic name or use random to select a mix of questions from multiple topics.
    - If random is chosen, you will be prompted to specify how many topics you'd like to be tested on, and how many questions per topic.

**Format**: `select /d timed|untimed /t TOPIC|Random`

**Example**:
   ```shell
    select /d timed /t loops
    OR
    select /d untimed /t random
   ```

### 3. Taking a Quiz
Once a topic is selected, the quiz begins with a series of questions in multiple-choice, True/False, or fill-in-the-blank formats.

> Note: The question types are randomised, so you may not be able to see all the question formats displayed in a single quiz session!

* **Exit Quiz**: Type `exit` anytime during the quiz to end it early.
* **Automatic Termination**: The quiz ends automatically if the time limit expires or the specified number of questions is completed.

This countdown feature ensures that users are aware of time constraints, enhancing the user experience and preventing unexpected quiz terminations.

**Example**:
   ```shell
   Set a time limit for the quiz.
   Enter the number of questions you want to attempt (Max 15): 10
   Enter the number of minutes for the quiz (or 0 to enter seconds): 
   Enter the number of seconds: 10
   ```

### 4. Adding a Flashcard: `add Flashcards`
Allows users to add their own quiz questions. Useful for your own revision in the future!

> Note: You're not allowed to add in any other custom topics other than flashcards!

Format: `add Flashcards /q [QUESTION] /a [ANSWER]`

* The `QUESTION` can be in a natural language format.
* The `ANSWER` cannot contain punctuation.

**Example**:
```shell
add Flashcards /q The keyword used to define a class is `____`. /a class
```

**Output Expected**:
```shell
Added flashcard: Q: The keyword used to define a class is `____`. A: class
```
