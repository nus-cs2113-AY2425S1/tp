 * The {@code CommandFactory} class is responsible for creating instances of various {@code Command} objects

 * <p>Supported Commands:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Program Commands - handled by {@code ProgCommandFactory}</li>
 *     <li>Meal Commands - handled by {@code MealCommandFactory}</li>
 *     <li>Water Commands - handled by {@code WaterCommandFactory}</li>
 *     <li>History Commands - handled by {@code HistoryCommandFactory}</li>
 *     <li>Exit Command - creates an {@code ExitCommand} directly</li>
 *     <li>Invalid Command - returns an {@code InvalidCommand} for unknown inputs</li>
