# Duke project template

This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are instructions on how to use it.


## Product Description
This product aims to streamline the tracking of internship applications for the user, where the user is able to store key details of the internship as well as save and edit the status of the application. 

**By using this tool, the user can:**

**Store Important seedu.easinternship.Internship Information:** Users can input and store key details such as the role, company, duration, required skills, application deadlines, and any additional notes.

**Track Application Status:** Users can save the current status of their application (e.g., not applied, applied, interview scheduled, offer received) and update it as the application progresses.

**Edit and Manage Internships:** Users have the ability to edit saved internships as needed, modify statuses, update deadlines, or remove outdated internships from the list.

**Filter Internships by Key Criteria:** The user can filter the tracked internships by relevant skills, application status, or upcoming deadlines, allowing for better organization and prioritization.

**Monitor Deadlines Easily:** The tool helps ensure users stay on top of their internship deadlines by flagging or sorting applications with approaching deadlines.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 17 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 17 in a previous Intellij project.
1. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
1. **Verify the setup**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   
   > Task :Duke.main()
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   
   What is your name?
   ```
   Type some word and press enter to let the execution proceed to the end.
